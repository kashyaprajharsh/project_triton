Security debt, defined for this report as flaws that remain unfixed for longer than a year, exists in 76 percent of organizations in the financial services sector, with 50 percent of organizations carrying critical security debt.\\n\\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241029540325/en/\\n\\nFigure 1: Prevalence of security debt in the financial sector (Graphic: Business Wire)\\n\\nWith the average cost of a data breach in the financial industry estimated to be $6.08 million 1, the research comes at a critical time for one of the most highly targeted industries by sophisticated threat actors. According to a U.S. Treasury Department report in March 2024, threat actors use AI-based tools to find and exploit software vulnerabilities at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, increasing industry competition and customer expectations for convenience require organizations to accelerate innovation.\\n\\n\"The high rate of security debt in the financial sector poses significant risks to organizations and their customers if not addressed quickly. As AI-driven cyber-attacks continue to grow in strength and numbers, and organizations struggle to keep up with evolving regulations due to existing security debt, the current landscape allows threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities at an alarming, unprecedented rate,\" said Chris Wysopal, Chief Security Evangelist at Veracode. \"Our latest State of Software research highlights the critical need for financial institutions to address both first-party and third-party code vulnerabilities now. Organizations that leave flaws unremedied for longer than a year are exposed to prolonged and dangerous threats.\"\\n\\nDelayed Flaw Remediation Threatens Financial Sector Security\\n\\nVeracode researchers found 40 percent of all applications in the financial sector have security debt, which is slightly better than the cross-industry average of 42 percent. In addition, just 5.5 percent of financial sector applications are flaw-free, compared to 5.9 percent across other industries. While slightly fewer financial sector applications have security debt, they accumulate more of it.\\n\\nThe report also highlights the need for financial services organizations to address security debt in both first-party and third-party code. Eighty-four percent of all security debt affects first-party code, but the majority (78.6 percent) of critical security debt comes from third-party dependencies. This reinforces the importance of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\\'s efforts to help secure the open-source ecosystem with its Open Source Software Security Roadmap and Secure by Design Pledge.\\n\\nThe analysis further explores remediation timelines in the financial services sector. Researchers found that financial organizations fix half of first-party flaws in the first nine months, compared to 13 months for third-party flaws. Of those, 52 percent of third-party flaws turn into security debt, while 44 percent of first-party flaws turn into security debt.\\n\\nThe Importance of Prioritization in Risk Remediation\\n\\nThe proliferation of supply chain attacks targeting the financial services industry has brought about a growing number of cybersecurity regulations with a sharper focus on software security. For example, regulatory frameworks like the ISO 20022, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), NIS2, and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) require organizations to prevent vulnerabilities from being deployed in applications.\\n\\nThis puts organizations at risk of non-compliance because of existing security debt and outdated remediation strategies. Veracode\\'s research reveals that organizations can address this risk by prioritizing the 3.3% of flaws that constitute critical security debt. Remediating the most dangerous flaws first means financial entities can then move on to tackle other critical flaws or non-critical debt according to their risk tolerance and capabilities.\\n\\nThe Role of Application Security Posture Management\\n\\nThe increased need for risk prioritization creates a significant demand for Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) to continuously track risk through the collection, visibility and analysis of security issues across the software development cycle. Veracode\\'s Application Risk Management Platform provides a comprehensive, unified view of risk across code and applications, empowering developers and security teams to remediate issues swiftly. With the AI-powered solution, Veracode Fix, teams can proactively prevent new vulnerabilities and effectively reduce existing security backlogs. The platform\\'s contextual analysis uncovers root causes, guiding developers toward optimal next steps that maximize risk reduction with minimal effort.\\n\\nWysopal closed, \"It has never been more important for the financial services sector to stay ahead of evolving cybersecurity threats, particularly with increasingly sophisticated AI-driven attacks threatening the security of their assets. I urge financial institutions to prioritize timely security debt reduction by adopting AI-powered remediation and ASPM tools which can detect, prioritize and fix vulnerabilities within seconds.\"\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security Financial Services 2024 report is available to read on the Veracode website.\\n\\n1 IBM, \" Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024 \", IBM and Ponemon Institute, July 30, 2024\\n\\nAbout the State of Software Security Report\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security 2024 report analyzed data from large and small companies, commercial software suppliers, software outsourcers, and open-source projects.

Security debt, defined for this report as flaws that remain unfixed for longer than a year, exists in 76 percent of organizations in the financial services sector, with 50 percent of organizations carrying critical security debt.\\n\\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241029540325/en/\\n\\nFigure 1: Prevalence of security debt in the financial sector (Graphic: Business Wire)\\n\\nWith the average cost of a data breach in the financial industry estimated to be $6.08 million 1, the research comes at a critical time for one of the most highly targeted industries by sophisticated threat actors. According to a U.S. Treasury Department report in March 2024, threat actors use AI-based tools to find and exploit software vulnerabilities at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, increasing industry competition and customer expectations for convenience require organizations to accelerate innovation.\\n\\n\"The high rate of security debt in the financial sector poses significant risks to organizations and their customers if not addressed quickly. As AI-driven cyber-attacks continue to grow in strength and numbers, and organizations struggle to keep up with evolving regulations due to existing security debt, the current landscape allows threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities at an alarming, unprecedented rate,\" said Chris Wysopal, Chief Security Evangelist at Veracode. \"Our latest State of Software research highlights the critical need for financial institutions to address both first-party and third-party code vulnerabilities now. Organizations that leave flaws unremedied for longer than a year are exposed to prolonged and dangerous threats.\"\\n\\nDelayed Flaw Remediation Threatens Financial Sector Security\\n\\nVeracode researchers found 40 percent of all applications in the financial sector have security debt, which is slightly better than the cross-industry average of 42 percent. In addition, just 5.5 percent of financial sector applications are flaw-free, compared to 5.9 percent across other industries. While slightly fewer financial sector applications have security debt, they accumulate more of it.\\n\\nThe report also highlights the need for financial services organizations to address security debt in both first-party and third-party code. Eighty-four percent of all security debt affects first-party code, but the majority (78.6 percent) of critical security debt comes from third-party dependencies. This reinforces the importance of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\\'s efforts to help secure the open-source ecosystem with its Open Source Software Security Roadmap and Secure by Design Pledge.\\n\\nThe analysis further explores remediation timelines in the financial services sector. Researchers found that financial organizations fix half of first-party flaws in the first nine months, compared to 13 months for third-party flaws. Of those, 52 percent of third-party flaws turn into security debt, while 44 percent of first-party flaws turn into security debt.\\n\\nThe Importance of Prioritization in Risk Remediation\\n\\nThe proliferation of supply chain attacks targeting the financial services industry has brought about a growing number of cybersecurity regulations with a sharper focus on software security. For example, regulatory frameworks like the ISO 20022, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), NIS2, and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) require organizations to prevent vulnerabilities from being deployed in applications.\\n\\nThis puts organizations at risk of non-compliance because of existing security debt and outdated remediation strategies. Veracode\\'s research reveals that organizations can address this risk by prioritizing the 3.3% of flaws that constitute critical security debt. Remediating the most dangerous flaws first means financial entities can then move on to tackle other critical flaws or non-critical debt according to their risk tolerance and capabilities.\\n\\nThe Role of Application Security Posture Management\\n\\nThe increased need for risk prioritization creates a significant demand for Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) to continuously track risk through the collection, visibility and analysis of security issues across the software development cycle. Veracode\\'s Application Risk Management Platform provides a comprehensive, unified view of risk across code and applications, empowering developers and security teams to remediate issues swiftly. With the AI-powered solution, Veracode Fix, teams can proactively prevent new vulnerabilities and effectively reduce existing security backlogs. The platform\\'s contextual analysis uncovers root causes, guiding developers toward optimal next steps that maximize risk reduction with minimal effort.\\n\\nWysopal closed, \"It has never been more important for the financial services sector to stay ahead of evolving cybersecurity threats, particularly with increasingly sophisticated AI-driven attacks threatening the security of their assets. I urge financial institutions to prioritize timely security debt reduction by adopting AI-powered remediation and ASPM tools which can detect, prioritize and fix vulnerabilities within seconds.\"\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security Financial Services 2024 report is available to read on the Veracode website.\\n\\n1 IBM, \" Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024 \", IBM and Ponemon Institute, July 30, 2024\\n\\nAbout the State of Software Security Report\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security 2024 report analyzed data from large and small companies, commercial software suppliers, software outsourcers, and open-source projects.

Security debt, defined for this report as flaws that remain unfixed for longer than a year, exists in 76 percent of organizations in the financial services sector, with 50 percent of organizations carrying critical security debt.\\n\\nWith the average cost of a data breach in the financial industry estimated to be $6.08 million, the research comes at a critical time for one of the most highly targeted industries by sophisticated threat actors. According to a U.S. Treasury Department report in March 2024, threat actors use AI-based tools to find and exploit software vulnerabilities at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, increasing industry competition and customer expectations for convenience require organizations to accelerate innovation.\\n\\n\"The high rate of security debt in the financial sector poses significant risks to organizations and their customers if not addressed quickly. As AI-driven cyber-attacks continue to grow in strength and numbers, and organizations struggle to keep up with evolving regulations due to existing security debt, the current landscape allows threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities at an alarming, unprecedented rate,\" said Chris Wysopal, Chief Security Evangelist at Veracode. \"Our latest State of Software research highlights the critical need for financial institutions to address both first-party and third-party code vulnerabilities now. Organizations that leave flaws unremedied for longer than a year are exposed to prolonged and dangerous threats.\"\\n\\nDelayed Flaw Remediation Threatens Financial Sector Security\\n\\nVeracode researchers found 40 percent of all applications in the financial sector have security debt, which is slightly better than the cross-industry average of 42 percent. In addition, just 5.5 percent of financial sector applications are flaw-free, compared to 5.9 percent across other industries. While slightly fewer financial sector applications have security debt, they accumulate more of it.\\n\\nThe report also highlights the need for financial services organizations to address security debt in both first-party and third-party code. Eighty-four percent of all security debt affects first-party code, but the majority (78.6 percent) of critical security debt comes from third-party dependencies. This reinforces the importance of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\\'s efforts to help secure the open-source ecosystem with its Open Source Software Security Roadmap and Secure by Design Pledge.\\n\\nThe analysis further explores remediation timelines in the financial services sector. Researchers found that financial organizations fix half of first-party flaws in the first nine months, compared to 13 months for third-party flaws. Of those, 52 percent of third-party flaws turn into security debt, while 44 percent of first-party flaws turn into security debt.\\n\\nThe Importance of Prioritization in Risk Remediation\\n\\nThe proliferation of supply chain attacks targeting the financial services industry has brought about a growing number of cybersecurity regulations with a sharper focus on software security. For example, regulatory frameworks like the ISO 20022, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), NIS2, and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) require organizations to prevent vulnerabilities from being deployed in applications.\\n\\nThis puts organizations at risk of non-compliance because of existing security debt and outdated remediation strategies. Veracode\\'s research reveals that organizations can address this risk by prioritizing the 3.3% of flaws that constitute critical security debt. Remediating the most dangerous flaws first means financial entities can then move on to tackle other critical flaws or non-critical debt according to their risk tolerance and capabilities.\\n\\nThe Role of Application Security Posture Management\\n\\nThe increased need for risk prioritization creates a significant demand for Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) to continuously track risk through the collection, visibility and analysis of security issues across the software development cycle. Veracode\\'s Application Risk Management Platform provides a comprehensive, unified view of risk across code and applications, empowering developers and security teams to remediate issues swiftly. With the AI-powered solution, Veracode Fix, teams can proactively prevent new vulnerabilities and effectively reduce existing security backlogs. The platform\\'s contextual analysis uncovers root causes, guiding developers toward optimal next steps that maximize risk reduction with minimal effort.\\n\\nWysopal closed, \"It has never been more important for the financial services sector to stay ahead of evolving cybersecurity threats, particularly with increasingly sophisticated AI-driven attacks threatening the security of their assets. I urge financial institutions to prioritize timely security debt reduction by adopting AI-powered remediation and ASPM tools which can detect, prioritize and fix vulnerabilities within seconds.\"\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security Financial Services 2024 report is available to read on the Veracode website.\\n\\nIBM, \"Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024\", IBM and Ponemon Institute, July 30, 2024\\n\\nAbout the State of Software Security Report\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security 2024 report analyzed data from large and small companies, commercial software suppliers, software outsourcers, and open-source projects.

BCG\\'s analysis reveals this market growth is driven by a favorable interest rate environment -- due to higher bank revenues from accounts -- and an overall expansion of banking revenue pools.\\n\\nIn parallel, the demand for embedded finance from small-and-medium-sized businesses (SMBs) -- a sector typically underserved by traditional financial institutions -- has broadened well beyond payments. This, coupled with the market\\'s expansion, opens a significant opportunity for SaaS platforms to embed into their offerings more advanced financial products like business accounts, loans, and issued cards. Given typical margins on these products, most platforms have an opportunity to multiply their current revenues by up to three or four times.\\n\\n\"Embedding financial products creates a win-win scenario: SaaS platforms deepen user relationships and unlock new revenue streams by addressing SMBs\\' overlooked financial needs,\" says Blake Breathitt, SVP Platforms & Financial Services at Adyen. \"Our research underscores the window of opportunity for SaaS platforms to embrace embedded finance to stay competitive, or get left behind. There is an immense market opportunity here for SaaS platforms, which are in an ideal position to deliver these within their existing ecosystems.\"\\n\\nThe market is primed with strong demand from SMBs with 50% of SMBs expressing a high likelihood of utilizing a full suite of embedded finance products in the near future, reinforcing its growth potential.\\n\\n\"We are observing an appetite from SMBs to consume a broader range of financial services from within their SaaS platforms, notably loans extending beyond simple cash advances or current accounts tightly integrated in receivables and payables workflows,\" says Stefan Dab, Founder of BCG\\'s Payments and Fintech practice.\\n\\nThe report highlights that top platforms are now generating more than 50% of their revenues from embedded payments and finance, and shines a light on embedded finance as the next critical growth lever for SaaS. To differentiate in an increasingly competitive market, platforms must consider integrating financial products in their offering.\\n\\nAdyen and BCG\\'s report provides a strategic playbook for SaaS platforms looking to succeed in the embedded finance space. It outlines actionable insights on differentiating products from traditional banks, optimizing go-to-market strategies, and forming effective partnerships to drive growth. To access the full report, click here.\\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nIn partnership with Boston Consulting Group, to reassess the state of embedded finance for SaaS platforms in 2024, we conducted quantitative and qualitative research with ~30 leading platforms and ~2,000 SMBs across North America, Europe and Australia in eight industries -- including F&B, Retail and Hospitality.\\n\\nAbout Adyen\\n\\nAdyen (ADYEN:AMS) is the financial technology platform of choice for leading companies.

BCG\\'s analysis reveals this market growth is driven by a favorable interest rate environment -- due to higher bank revenues from accounts -- and an overall expansion of banking revenue pools.\\n\\nIn parallel, the demand for embedded finance from small-and-medium-sized businesses (SMBs) -- a sector typically underserved by traditional financial institutions -- has broadened well beyond payments.1 This, coupled with the market\\'s expansion, opens a significant opportunity for SaaS platforms to embed into their offerings more advanced financial products like business accounts, loans, and issued cards. Given typical margins on these products, most platforms have an opportunity to multiply their current revenues by up to three or four times.\\n\\n\"Embedding financial products creates a win-win scenario: SaaS platforms deepen user relationships and unlock new revenue streams by addressing SMBs\\' overlooked financial needs,\" says Blake Breathitt , SVP Platforms & Financial Services at Adyen. \"Our research underscores the window of opportunity for SaaS platforms to embrace embedded finance to stay competitive, or get left behind.

Under the agreement, the joint venture arrangement of BTS and Terne Holdings will hold a 30% stake in The One Destination.\\n\\nThe One Destination is the developer of the Haus Da Lat project. The company is a leader in developing ESG real estate in Vietnam, actively engaged in numerous ongoing projects nationwide, and maintains a substantial land reserve. The project spans 5 hectares and has a total investment of VND 1.700 billion (~ USD 68m). It is in a prime area by the serene Xuan Huong Lake, one of Vietnam\\'s most picturesque natural lakes and a symbol of Da Lat.\\n\\nAccording to the plan, The One Destination will build Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard real estate complex on the last remaining prime land in Da Lat\\'s city center. Designed by renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, Haus Da Lat is expected to become a heritage symbol for the 130-year-old city and position Vietnam on the global ESG real estate map.\\n\\nThe decision of the international partners, to select Da Lat as their first investment destination in Vietnam highlights the city\\'s unique appeal. The partners emphasize that in a tropical country like Vietnam, Da Lat - a highland city with year-round cool weather surrounded by tranquil lakes, vast pine forests, magnificent waterfalls, and vibrant flower fields -- is a natural masterpiece. This city, often called a \"natural heritage,\" deserves real estate projects that reflect its value.\\n\\n\"We were captivated by Da Lat at first sight, and are proud to be one of the pioneering foreign investors in Da Lat\" said the representative of BTS.\\n\\nOn June 20, 2024, the Ministry of Transport issued Decision No. 758/QD-BGTVT to upgrade Lien Khuong Airport to an international airport, igniting a boom in Da Lat\\'s economy, tourism, and the entire Lam Dong province. In the first half of 2024, Lam Dong welcomed 5 million tourists, an increase of over 12%. By the end of 2024, the province is expected to receive 10 million visitors, including 550,000 international tourists. According to the 2030 plan, Lien Khuong Airport will expand to nearly 487 hectares and accommodate 5 million passengers annually, with flights from various countries worldwide.\\n\\nESG real estate is gaining traction in many developed countries and is expected to become a significant global trend in the next century. This is why the investors are partnering with The One Destination to launch a new era of ESG real estate in Vietnam, starting in Da Lat and expanding to other projects. With Vietnam\\'s dynamic economy ranking among Asia\\'s top, an average GDP growth of 6-7% annually, and a rapidly growing middle class expected to reach 40% of the population by 2030, the country\\'s real estate market is poised for a significant boom in the ESG segment. Leading companies like The One Destination will have the advantage in shaping this trend. Haus Da Lat is highly valued for its ESG-compliant design, choice of materials, construction, and operations, and focus on the human factor, aligning with the ESG goals, creating long-term value for future generations.\\n\\nCaroline Lee, Chairwoman of Terne Holdings, affirmed, \"Together with The One Destination and BTS, we will create a heritage landmark for Da Lat, Vietnam. We are proud to be among the pioneering foreign investors working alongside Vietnam\\'s real estate developers to build and preserve Da Lat in the face of the city\\'s concrete overdevelopment\".\\n\\nTerne Holdings also stated that the investment in Haus Da Lat aligns with its ongoing ESG strategy. This strategy is based on practical, measurable actions and aligns with 12 United Nations\\' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\n\\n\"The best is often saved for last, and Haus Da Lat will be Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard landmark project, a heritage for Da Lat,\" said a representative from The One Destination. Five leading international brands are also expected to join forces to create a new icon for Da Lat.\\n\\nReference Information\\n\\nThe One Destination stands at the forefront of ESG real estate development in Vietnam. We strive to address environmental challenges, minimize our ecological footprint and enhance the local environment by employing sustainable building materials and energy-efficient technologies.\\n\\nBTS Bernina Private Equity Fund is an open-end investment company whose size exceeding USD 368 million, with 60% invested in Asia.

BCG\\'s analysis reveals this market growth is driven by a favorable interest rate environment \" due to higher bank revenues from accounts \" and an overall expansion of banking revenue pools.\\n\\nIn parallel, the demand for embedded finance from small-and-medium-sized businesses (SMBs) \" a sector typically underserved by traditional financial institutions \" has broadened well beyond payments. This, coupled with the market\\'s expansion, opens a significant opportunity for SaaS platforms to embed into their offerings more advanced financial products like business accounts, loans, and issued cards. Given typical margins on these products, most platforms have an opportunity to multiply their current revenues by up to three or four times.\\n\\n\"Embedding financial products creates a win-win scenario: SaaS platforms deepen user relationships and unlock new revenue streams by addressing SMBs\\' overlooked financial needs,\" says , SVP Platforms & Financial Services at Adyen. \"Our research underscores the window of opportunity for SaaS platforms to embrace embedded finance to stay competitive, or get left behind. There is an immense market opportunity here for SaaS platforms, which are in an ideal position to deliver these within their existing ecosystems.\"\\n\\nThe market is primed with strong demand from SMBs with 50% of SMBs expressing a high likelihood of utilizing a full suite of embedded finance products in the near future, reinforcing its growth potential.\\n\\n\"We are observing an appetite from SMBs to consume a broader range of financial services from within their SaaS platforms, notably loans extending beyond simple cash advances or current accounts tightly integrated in receivables and payables workflows,\" says Stefan Dab, Founder of BCG\\'s Payments and Fintech practice.\\n\\nThe report highlights that top platforms are now generating more than 50% of their revenues from embedded payments and finance, and shines a light on embedded finance as the next critical growth lever for SaaS. To differentiate in an increasingly competitive market, platforms must consider integrating financial products in their offering.\\n\\nAdyen and BCG\\'s report provides a strategic playbook for SaaS platforms looking to succeed in the embedded finance space. It outlines actionable insights on differentiating products from traditional banks, optimizing go-to-market strategies, and forming effective partnerships to drive growth.

The order sought to limit the access that \"countries of concern\\'\\' -- specifically, China, Hong Kong and Macau -- have to American dollars to fund technologies that could be used, for example, to break codes or develop next-generation fighter jets. It will take effect Jan. 2.\\n\\n\"U.S. investments ... must not be used to help countries of concern develop their military, intelligence and cyber capabilities\\'\\'\\' said Paul Rosen, assistant Treasury secretary for investment security. He noted the investments can mean more than just money; they can deliver \"intangible benefits,\\'\\' including managerial help and assistance finding top talent and tapping other sources of financing.\\n\\nBlocking China\\'s high-tech ambitions is one of the few issues that enjoys broad support in Washington from both Republicans and Democrats.\\n\\nBiden in May slapped a stiff tariff on electric vehicles from China. He also has imposed export controls to keep the Chinese from acquiring advanced computer chips and the equipment to produce them. Former President Donald Trump has vowed to dramatically increase taxes on all imports from China if voters send him back to the White House.\\n\\nThe Biden administration sought comment from businesses and from U.S. allies before putting out the final version.\\n\\nIn addition to blocking investments, the rule requires Americans and companies in the United States to notify the U.S. government of transactions that involve \"technologies and products that may contribute to a threat to the national security of the United States.\\'\\'\\n\\nViolators can be hit with fines of up to $368,136 or twice the value of the prohibited transaction, whichever is greater.

The order sought to limit the access that \"countries of concern\\'\\' -- specifically China including Hong Kong and Macao -- have to American dollars to fund technologies that could be used, for example, to break codes or develop next-generation fighter jets. It will take effect Jan. 2.\\n\\n\"U.S. investments ... must not be used to help countries of concern develop their military, intelligence and cyber capabilities\\'\\'\\' said Paul Rosen, assistant Treasury secretary for investment security. He noted the investments can mean more than just money: they can deliver \"intangible benefits,\\'\\' including managerial help and assistance finding top talent and tapping other sources of financing.\\n\\nBlocking China\\'s high-tech ambitions is one of the few issues that enjoys broad support in Washington from both Republicans and Democrats.\\n\\nBiden in May slapped a stiff tariff on electric vehicles from China. He also has imposed export controls to keep the Chinese from acquiring advanced computer chips and the equipment to produce them. Former President Donald Trump has vowed to dramatically increase taxes on all imports from China if voters send him back to the White House.\\n\\nA Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Tuesday that the government had lodged a protest with the U.S. over the latest action.\\n\\n\"China strongly deplores and firmly opposes the U.S. rolling out restrictions on investment in China,\" Lin Jian said at a daily briefing in Beijing.\\n\\nIn Hong Kong, the city\\'s leader said the move undermined normal investment and trade and would cause damage to the global supply chain.\\n\\n\"In pursuing their political agenda, American politicians are harming not only others but also the interests of their own country, their people and their businesses. They will have to face the consequences of their actions,\" John Lee said, noting that the U.S. has enjoyed a trade surplus of $472 billion with Hong Kong in the past 10 years.\\n\\nThe Biden administration sought comment from businesses and from U.S. allies before putting out the final version.\\n\\nIn addition to blocking investments, the rule requires Americans and companies in the United States to notify the U.S. government of transactions that involve \"technologies and products that may contribute to a threat to the national security of the United States.\\'\\'', 'source': {'uri': 'ca.finance.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo!

Security debt, defined for this report as flaws that remain unfixed for longer than a year, exists in 76 percent of organizations in the financial services sector, with 50 percent of organizations carrying critical security debt.\\n\\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241029540325/en/\\n\\nFigure 1: Prevalence of security debt in the financial sector (Graphic: Business Wire)\\n\\nWith the average cost of a data breach in the financial industry estimated to be $6.08 million 1, the research comes at a critical time for one of the most highly targeted industries by sophisticated threat actors. According to a U.S. Treasury Department report in March 2024, threat actors use AI-based tools to find and exploit software vulnerabilities at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, increasing industry competition and customer expectations for convenience require organizations to accelerate innovation.\\n\\n\"The high rate of security debt in the financial sector poses significant risks to organizations and their customers if not addressed quickly. As AI-driven cyber-attacks continue to grow in strength and numbers, and organizations struggle to keep up with evolving regulations due to existing security debt, the current landscape allows threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities at an alarming, unprecedented rate,\" said Chris Wysopal, Chief Security Evangelist at Veracode. \"Our latest State of Software research highlights the critical need for financial institutions to address both first-party and third-party code vulnerabilities now. Organizations that leave flaws unremedied for longer than a year are exposed to prolonged and dangerous threats.\"\\n\\nDelayed Flaw Remediation Threatens Financial Sector Security\\n\\nVeracode researchers found 40 percent of all applications in the financial sector have security debt, which is slightly better than the cross-industry average of 42 percent. In addition, just 5.5 percent of financial sector applications are flaw-free, compared to 5.9 percent across other industries. While slightly fewer financial sector applications have security debt, they accumulate more of it.\\n\\nThe report also highlights the need for financial services organizations to address security debt in both first-party and third-party code. Eighty-four percent of all security debt affects first-party code, but the majority (78.6 percent) of critical security debt comes from third-party dependencies. This reinforces the importance of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\\'s efforts to help secure the open-source ecosystem with its Open Source Software Security Roadmap and Secure by Design Pledge.\\n\\nThe analysis further explores remediation timelines in the financial services sector. Researchers found that financial organizations fix half of first-party flaws in the first nine months, compared to 13 months for third-party flaws. Of those, 52 percent of third-party flaws turn into security debt, while 44 percent of first-party flaws turn into security debt.\\n\\nThe Importance of Prioritization in Risk Remediation\\n\\nThe proliferation of supply chain attacks targeting the financial services industry has brought about a growing number of cybersecurity regulations with a sharper focus on software security. For example, regulatory frameworks like the ISO 20022, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), NIS2, and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) require organizations to prevent vulnerabilities from being deployed in applications.\\n\\nThis puts organizations at risk of non-compliance because of existing security debt and outdated remediation strategies. Veracode\\'s research reveals that organizations can address this risk by prioritizing the 3.3% of flaws that constitute critical security debt. Remediating the most dangerous flaws first means financial entities can then move on to tackle other critical flaws or non-critical debt according to their risk tolerance and capabilities.\\n\\nThe Role of Application Security Posture Management\\n\\nThe increased need for risk prioritization creates a significant demand for Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) to continuously track risk through the collection, visibility and analysis of security issues across the software development cycle. Veracode\\'s Application Risk Management Platform provides a comprehensive, unified view of risk across code and applications, empowering developers and security teams to remediate issues swiftly. With the AI-powered solution, Veracode Fix, teams can proactively prevent new vulnerabilities and effectively reduce existing security backlogs. The platform\\'s contextual analysis uncovers root causes, guiding developers toward optimal next steps that maximize risk reduction with minimal effort.\\n\\nWysopal closed, \"It has never been more important for the financial services sector to stay ahead of evolving cybersecurity threats, particularly with increasingly sophisticated AI-driven attacks threatening the security of their assets. I urge financial institutions to prioritize timely security debt reduction by adopting AI-powered remediation and ASPM tools which can detect, prioritize and fix vulnerabilities within seconds.\"\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security Financial Services 2024 report is available to read on the Veracode website.\\n\\n1 IBM, \" Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024 \", IBM and Ponemon Institute, July 30, 2024\\n\\nAbout the State of Software Security Report\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security 2024 report analyzed data from large and small companies, commercial software suppliers, software outsourcers, and open-source projects.

Under the agreement, the joint venture arrangement of BTS and Terne Holdings will hold a 30% stake in The One Destination.\\n\\nThe One Destination is the developer of the Haus Da Lat project. The company is a leader in developing ESG real estate in Vietnam, actively engaged in numerous ongoing projects nationwide, and maintains a substantial land reserve. The project spans 5 hectares and has a total investment of VND 1.700 billion (~ USD 68m). It is in a prime area by the serene Xuan Huong Lake, one of Vietnam\\'s most picturesque natural lakes and a symbol of Da Lat.\\n\\nAccording to the plan, The One Destination will build Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard real estate complex on the last remaining prime land in Da Lat\\'s city center. Designed by renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, Haus Da Lat is expected to become a heritage symbol for the 130-year-old city and position Vietnam on the global ESG real estate map.\\n\\nThe decision of the international partners, to select Da Lat as their first investment destination in Vietnam highlights the city\\'s unique appeal. The partners emphasize that in a tropical country like Vietnam, Da Lat - a highland city with year-round cool weather surrounded by tranquil lakes, vast pine forests, magnificent waterfalls, and vibrant flower fields -- is a natural masterpiece. This city, often called a \"natural heritage,\" deserves real estate projects that reflect its value.\\n\\n\"We were captivated by Da Lat at first sight, and are proud to be one of the pioneering foreign investors in Da Lat\" said the representative of BTS.\\n\\nOn June 20, 2024, the Ministry of Transport issued Decision No. 758/QD-BGTVT to upgrade Lien Khuong Airport to an international airport, igniting a boom in Da Lat\\'s economy, tourism, and the entire Lam Dong province. In the first half of 2024, Lam Dong welcomed 5 million tourists, an increase of over 12%. By the end of 2024, the province is expected to receive 10 million visitors, including 550,000 international tourists. According to the 2030 plan, Lien Khuong Airport will expand to nearly 487 hectares and accommodate 5 million passengers annually, with flights from various countries worldwide.\\n\\nESG real estate is gaining traction in many developed countries and is expected to become a significant global trend in the next century. This is why the investors are partnering with The One Destination to launch a new era of ESG real estate in Vietnam, starting in Da Lat and expanding to other projects. With Vietnam\\'s dynamic economy ranking among Asia\\'s top, an average GDP growth of 6-7% annually, and a rapidly growing middle class expected to reach 40% of the population by 2030, the country\\'s real estate market is poised for a significant boom in the ESG segment. Leading companies like The One Destination will have the advantage in shaping this trend. Haus Da Lat is highly valued for its ESG-compliant design, choice of materials, construction, and operations, and focus on the human factor, aligning with the ESG goals, creating long-term value for future generations.\\n\\nCaroline Lee, Chairwoman of Terne Holdings, affirmed, \"Together with The One Destination and BTS, we will create a heritage landmark for Da Lat, Vietnam. We are proud to be among the pioneering foreign investors working alongside Vietnam\\'s real estate developers to build and preserve Da Lat in the face of the city\\'s concrete overdevelopment\".\\n\\nTerne Holdings also stated that the investment in Haus Da Lat aligns with its ongoing ESG strategy. This strategy is based on practical, measurable actions and aligns with 12 United Nations\\' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\n\\n\"The best is often saved for last, and Haus Da Lat will be Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard landmark project, a heritage for Da Lat,\" said a representative from The One Destination. Five leading international brands are also expected to join forces to create a new icon for Da Lat.\\n\\nReference Information\\n\\nThe One Destination stands at the forefront of ESG real estate development in Vietnam. We strive to address environmental challenges, minimize our ecological footprint and enhance the local environment by employing sustainable building materials and energy-efficient technologies.\\n\\nBTS Bernina Private Equity Fund is an open-end investment company whose size exceeding USD 368 million, with 60% invested in Asia.

The order sought to limit the access that \"countries of concern\\'\\' -- specifically, China, Hong Kong and Macau -- have to American dollars to fund technologies that could be used, for example, to break codes or develop next-generation fighter jets. It will take effect Jan. 2.\\n\\n\"U.S. investments ... must not be used to help countries of concern develop their military, intelligence and cyber capabilities\\'\\'\\' said Paul Rosen, assistant Treasury secretary for investment security.

He also has imposed export controls to keep the Chinese from acquiring advanced computer chips and the equipment to produce them. Former President Donald Trump has vowed to dramatically increase taxes on all imports from China if voters send him back to the White House.\\n\\nThe Biden administration sought comment from businesses and from U.S. allies before putting out the final version.\\n\\nIn addition to blocking investments, the rule requires Americans and companies in the United States to notify the U.S. government of transactions that involve \"technologies and products that may contribute to a threat to the national security of the United States.\\'\\'\\n\\nViolators can be hit with fines of up to $368,136 or twice the value of the prohibited transaction, whichever is greater. Treasury is setting up an Office of Global Transactions to oversee the new rule.\\n\\nIn his weekly briefing on Tuesday, Hong Kong leader John Lee said the restrictions once again reflected some U.S. politicians were undermining normal investment and trade for their political interests, and these acts would cause harm to the global supply chain. Lee said the U.S. has enjoyed a trade surplus of $472 billion with Hong Kong in the past 10 years.\\n\\n\"In pursuing their political agenda, American politicians are harming not only others but also the interests of their own country, their people and their businesses.

It will take effect Jan. 2.\\n\\n\"U.S. investments ... must not be used to help countries of concern develop their military, intelligence and cyber capabilities\\'\\'\\' said Paul Rosen, assistant Treasury secretary for investment security.

It will take effect Jan. 2.\\n\\n\"U.S. investments ... must not be used to help countries of concern develop their military, intelligence and cyber capabilities\\'\\'\\' said Paul Rosen, assistant Treasury secretary for investment security.

Security debt, defined for this report as flaws that remain unfixed for longer than a year, exists in 76 percent of organizations in the financial services sector, with 50 percent of organizations carrying critical security debt.\\n\\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241029540325/en/\\n\\nFigure 1: Prevalence of security debt in the financial sector (Graphic: Business Wire)\\n\\nWith the average cost of a data breach in the financial industry estimated to be $6.08 million 1, the research comes at a critical time for one of the most highly targeted industries by sophisticated threat actors. According to a U.S. Treasury Department report in March 2024, threat actors use AI-based tools to find and exploit software vulnerabilities at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, increasing industry competition and customer expectations for convenience require organizations to accelerate innovation.\\n\\n\"The high rate of security debt in the financial sector poses significant risks to organizations and their customers if not addressed quickly. As AI-driven cyber-attacks continue to grow in strength and numbers, and organizations struggle to keep up with evolving regulations due to existing security debt, the current landscape allows threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities at an alarming, unprecedented rate,\" said Chris Wysopal, Chief Security Evangelist at Veracode. \"Our latest State of Software research highlights the critical need for financial institutions to address both first-party and third-party code vulnerabilities now. Organizations that leave flaws unremedied for longer than a year are exposed to prolonged and dangerous threats.\"\\n\\nDelayed Flaw Remediation Threatens Financial Sector Security\\n\\nVeracode researchers found 40 percent of all applications in the financial sector have security debt, which is slightly better than the cross-industry average of 42 percent. In addition, just 5.5 percent of financial sector applications are flaw-free, compared to 5.9 percent across other industries. While slightly fewer financial sector applications have security debt, they accumulate more of it.\\n\\nThe report also highlights the need for financial services organizations to address security debt in both first-party and third-party code. Eighty-four percent of all security debt affects first-party code, but the majority (78.6 percent) of critical security debt comes from third-party dependencies. This reinforces the importance of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\\'s efforts to help secure the open-source ecosystem with its Open Source Software Security Roadmap and Secure by Design Pledge.\\n\\nThe analysis further explores remediation timelines in the financial services sector. Researchers found that financial organizations fix half of first-party flaws in the first nine months, compared to 13 months for third-party flaws. Of those, 52 percent of third-party flaws turn into security debt, while 44 percent of first-party flaws turn into security debt.\\n\\nThe Importance of Prioritization in Risk Remediation\\n\\nThe proliferation of supply chain attacks targeting the financial services industry has brought about a growing number of cybersecurity regulations with a sharper focus on software security. For example, regulatory frameworks like the ISO 20022, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), NIS2, and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) require organizations to prevent vulnerabilities from being deployed in applications.\\n\\nThis puts organizations at risk of non-compliance because of existing security debt and outdated remediation strategies. Veracode\\'s research reveals that organizations can address this risk by prioritizing the 3.3% of flaws that constitute critical security debt. Remediating the most dangerous flaws first means financial entities can then move on to tackle other critical flaws or non-critical debt according to their risk tolerance and capabilities.\\n\\nThe Role of Application Security Posture Management\\n\\nThe increased need for risk prioritization creates a significant demand for Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) to continuously track risk through the collection, visibility and analysis of security issues across the software development cycle. Veracode\\'s Application Risk Management Platform provides a comprehensive, unified view of risk across code and applications, empowering developers and security teams to remediate issues swiftly. With the AI-powered solution, Veracode Fix, teams can proactively prevent new vulnerabilities and effectively reduce existing security backlogs. The platform\\'s contextual analysis uncovers root causes, guiding developers toward optimal next steps that maximize risk reduction with minimal effort.\\n\\nWysopal closed, \"It has never been more important for the financial services sector to stay ahead of evolving cybersecurity threats, particularly with increasingly sophisticated AI-driven attacks threatening the security of their assets. I urge financial institutions to prioritize timely security debt reduction by adopting AI-powered remediation and ASPM tools which can detect, prioritize and fix vulnerabilities within seconds.\"\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security Financial Services 2024 report is available to read on the Veracode website.\\n\\n1 IBM, \" Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024 \", IBM and Ponemon Institute, July 30, 2024\\n\\nAbout the State of Software Security Report\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security 2024 report analyzed data from large and small companies, commercial software suppliers, software outsourcers, and open-source projects.

Security debt, defined for this report as flaws that remain unfixed for longer than a year, exists in 76 percent of organizations in the financial services sector, with 50 percent of organizations carrying critical security debt.\\n\\nWith the average cost of a data breach in the financial industry estimated to be $6.08 million, the research comes at a critical time for one of the most highly targeted industries by sophisticated threat actors. According to a U.S. Treasury Department report in March 2024, threat actors use AI-based tools to find and exploit software vulnerabilities at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, increasing industry competition and customer expectations for convenience require organizations to accelerate innovation.\\n\\n\"The high rate of security debt in the financial sector poses significant risks to organizations and their customers if not addressed quickly. As AI-driven cyber-attacks continue to grow in strength and numbers, and organizations struggle to keep up with evolving regulations due to existing security debt, the current landscape allows threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities at an alarming, unprecedented rate,\" said Chris Wysopal, Chief Security Evangelist at Veracode. \"Our latest State of Software research highlights the critical need for financial institutions to address both first-party and third-party code vulnerabilities now. Organizations that leave flaws unremedied for longer than a year are exposed to prolonged and dangerous threats.\"\\n\\nDelayed Flaw Remediation Threatens Financial Sector Security\\n\\nVeracode researchers found 40 percent of all applications in the financial sector have security debt, which is slightly better than the cross-industry average of 42 percent. In addition, just 5.5 percent of financial sector applications are flaw-free, compared to 5.9 percent across other industries. While slightly fewer financial sector applications have security debt, they accumulate more of it.\\n\\nThe report also highlights the need for financial services organizations to address security debt in both first-party and third-party code. Eighty-four percent of all security debt affects first-party code, but the majority (78.6 percent) of critical security debt comes from third-party dependencies. This reinforces the importance of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\\'s efforts to help secure the open-source ecosystem with its Open Source Software Security Roadmap and Secure by Design Pledge.\\n\\nThe analysis further explores remediation timelines in the financial services sector. Researchers found that financial organizations fix half of first-party flaws in the first nine months, compared to 13 months for third-party flaws. Of those, 52 percent of third-party flaws turn into security debt, while 44 percent of first-party flaws turn into security debt.\\n\\nThe Importance of Prioritization in Risk Remediation\\n\\nThe proliferation of supply chain attacks targeting the financial services industry has brought about a growing number of cybersecurity regulations with a sharper focus on software security. For example, regulatory frameworks like the ISO 20022, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), NIS2, and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) require organizations to prevent vulnerabilities from being deployed in applications.\\n\\nThis puts organizations at risk of non-compliance because of existing security debt and outdated remediation strategies. Veracode\\'s research reveals that organizations can address this risk by prioritizing the 3.3% of flaws that constitute critical security debt. Remediating the most dangerous flaws first means financial entities can then move on to tackle other critical flaws or non-critical debt according to their risk tolerance and capabilities.\\n\\nThe Role of Application Security Posture Management\\n\\nThe increased need for risk prioritization creates a significant demand for Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) to continuously track risk through the collection, visibility and analysis of security issues across the software development cycle. Veracode\\'s Application Risk Management Platform provides a comprehensive, unified view of risk across code and applications, empowering developers and security teams to remediate issues swiftly. With the AI-powered solution, Veracode Fix, teams can proactively prevent new vulnerabilities and effectively reduce existing security backlogs. The platform\\'s contextual analysis uncovers root causes, guiding developers toward optimal next steps that maximize risk reduction with minimal effort.\\n\\nWysopal closed, \"It has never been more important for the financial services sector to stay ahead of evolving cybersecurity threats, particularly with increasingly sophisticated AI-driven attacks threatening the security of their assets. I urge financial institutions to prioritize timely security debt reduction by adopting AI-powered remediation and ASPM tools which can detect, prioritize and fix vulnerabilities within seconds.\"\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security Financial Services 2024 report is available to read on the Veracode website.\\n\\nIBM, \"Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024\", IBM and Ponemon Institute, July 30, 2024\\n\\nAbout the State of Software Security Report\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security 2024 report analyzed data from large and small companies, commercial software suppliers, software outsourcers, and open-source projects.

Security debt, defined for this report as flaws that remain unfixed for longer than a year, exists in 76 percent of organizations in the financial services sector, with 50 percent of organizations carrying critical security debt.\\n\\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241029540325/en/\\n\\nFigure 1: Prevalence of security debt in the financial sector (Graphic: Business Wire)\\n\\nWith the average cost of a data breach in the financial industry estimated to be $6.08 million 1, the research comes at a critical time for one of the most highly targeted industries by sophisticated threat actors. According to a U.S. Treasury Department report in March 2024, threat actors use AI-based tools to find and exploit software vulnerabilities at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, increasing industry competition and customer expectations for convenience require organizations to accelerate innovation.\\n\\n\"The high rate of security debt in the financial sector poses significant risks to organizations and their customers if not addressed quickly. As AI-driven cyber-attacks continue to grow in strength and numbers, and organizations struggle to keep up with evolving regulations due to existing security debt, the current landscape allows threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities at an alarming, unprecedented rate,\" said Chris Wysopal, Chief Security Evangelist at Veracode. \"Our latest State of Software research highlights the critical need for financial institutions to address both first-party and third-party code vulnerabilities now. Organizations that leave flaws unremedied for longer than a year are exposed to prolonged and dangerous threats.\"\\n\\nDelayed Flaw Remediation Threatens Financial Sector Security\\n\\nVeracode researchers found 40 percent of all applications in the financial sector have security debt, which is slightly better than the cross-industry average of 42 percent. In addition, just 5.5 percent of financial sector applications are flaw-free, compared to 5.9 percent across other industries. While slightly fewer financial sector applications have security debt, they accumulate more of it.\\n\\nThe report also highlights the need for financial services organizations to address security debt in both first-party and third-party code. Eighty-four percent of all security debt affects first-party code, but the majority (78.6 percent) of critical security debt comes from third-party dependencies. This reinforces the importance of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\\'s efforts to help secure the open-source ecosystem with its Open Source Software Security Roadmap and Secure by Design Pledge.\\n\\nThe analysis further explores remediation timelines in the financial services sector. Researchers found that financial organizations fix half of first-party flaws in the first nine months, compared to 13 months for third-party flaws. Of those, 52 percent of third-party flaws turn into security debt, while 44 percent of first-party flaws turn into security debt.\\n\\nThe Importance of Prioritization in Risk Remediation\\n\\nThe proliferation of supply chain attacks targeting the financial services industry has brought about a growing number of cybersecurity regulations with a sharper focus on software security. For example, regulatory frameworks like the ISO 20022, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), NIS2, and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) require organizations to prevent vulnerabilities from being deployed in applications.\\n\\nThis puts organizations at risk of non-compliance because of existing security debt and outdated remediation strategies. Veracode\\'s research reveals that organizations can address this risk by prioritizing the 3.3% of flaws that constitute critical security debt. Remediating the most dangerous flaws first means financial entities can then move on to tackle other critical flaws or non-critical debt according to their risk tolerance and capabilities.\\n\\nThe Role of Application Security Posture Management\\n\\nThe increased need for risk prioritization creates a significant demand for Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) to continuously track risk through the collection, visibility and analysis of security issues across the software development cycle. Veracode\\'s Application Risk Management Platform provides a comprehensive, unified view of risk across code and applications, empowering developers and security teams to remediate issues swiftly. With the AI-powered solution, Veracode Fix, teams can proactively prevent new vulnerabilities and effectively reduce existing security backlogs. The platform\\'s contextual analysis uncovers root causes, guiding developers toward optimal next steps that maximize risk reduction with minimal effort.\\n\\nWysopal closed, \"It has never been more important for the financial services sector to stay ahead of evolving cybersecurity threats, particularly with increasingly sophisticated AI-driven attacks threatening the security of their assets. I urge financial institutions to prioritize timely security debt reduction by adopting AI-powered remediation and ASPM tools which can detect, prioritize and fix vulnerabilities within seconds.\"\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security Financial Services 2024 report is available to read on the Veracode website.\\n\\n1 IBM, \" Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024 \", IBM and Ponemon Institute, July 30, 2024\\n\\nAbout the State of Software Security Report\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security 2024 report analyzed data from large and small companies, commercial software suppliers, software outsourcers, and open-source projects.

BCG\\'s analysis reveals this market growth is driven by a favorable interest rate environment -- due to higher bank revenues from accounts -- and an overall expansion of banking revenue pools.\\n\\nIn parallel, the demand for embedded finance from small-and-medium-sized businesses (SMBs) -- a sector typically underserved by traditional financial institutions -- has broadened well beyond payments. This, coupled with the market\\'s expansion, opens a significant opportunity for SaaS platforms to embed into their offerings more advanced financial products like business accounts, loans, and issued cards. Given typical margins on these products, most platforms have an opportunity to multiply their current revenues by up to three or four times.\\n\\n\"Embedding financial products creates a win-win scenario: SaaS platforms deepen user relationships and unlock new revenue streams by addressing SMBs\\' overlooked financial needs,\" says Blake Breathitt, SVP Platforms & Financial Services at Adyen. \"Our research underscores the window of opportunity for SaaS platforms to embrace embedded finance to stay competitive, or get left behind. There is an immense market opportunity here for SaaS platforms, which are in an ideal position to deliver these within their existing ecosystems.\"\\n\\nThe market is primed with strong demand from SMBs with 50% of SMBs expressing a high likelihood of utilizing a full suite of embedded finance products in the near future, reinforcing its growth potential.\\n\\n\"We are observing an appetite from SMBs to consume a broader range of financial services from within their SaaS platforms, notably loans extending beyond simple cash advances or current accounts tightly integrated in receivables and payables workflows,\" says Stefan Dab, Founder of BCG\\'s Payments and Fintech practice.\\n\\nThe report highlights that top platforms are now generating more than 50% of their revenues from embedded payments and finance, and shines a light on embedded finance as the next critical growth lever for SaaS. To differentiate in an increasingly competitive market, platforms must consider integrating financial products in their offering.\\n\\nAdyen and BCG\\'s report provides a strategic playbook for SaaS platforms looking to succeed in the embedded finance space. It outlines actionable insights on differentiating products from traditional banks, optimizing go-to-market strategies, and forming effective partnerships to drive growth. To access the full report, click here.\\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nIn partnership with Boston Consulting Group, to reassess the state of embedded finance for SaaS platforms in 2024, we conducted quantitative and qualitative research with ~30 leading platforms and ~2,000 SMBs across North America, Europe and Australia in eight industries -- including F&B, Retail and Hospitality.\\n\\nAbout Adyen\\n\\nAdyen (ADYEN:AMS) is the financial technology platform of choice for leading companies.

Under the agreement, the joint venture arrangement of BTS and Terne Holdings will hold a 30% stake in The One Destination.\\n\\nThe One Destination is the developer of the Haus Da Lat project. The company is a leader in developing ESG real estate in Vietnam, actively engaged in numerous ongoing projects nationwide, and maintains a substantial land reserve. The project spans 5 hectares and has a total investment of VND 1.700 billion (~ USD 68m). It is in a prime area by the serene Xuan Huong Lake, one of Vietnam\\'s most picturesque natural lakes and a symbol of Da Lat.\\n\\nAccording to the plan, The One Destination will build Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard real estate complex on the last remaining prime land in Da Lat\\'s city center. Designed by renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, Haus Da Lat is expected to become a heritage symbol for the 130-year-old city and position Vietnam on the global ESG real estate map.\\n\\nThe decision of the international partners, to select Da Lat as their first investment destination in Vietnam highlights the city\\'s unique appeal. The partners emphasize that in a tropical country like Vietnam, Da Lat - a highland city with year-round cool weather surrounded by tranquil lakes, vast pine forests, magnificent waterfalls, and vibrant flower fields -- is a natural masterpiece. This city, often called a \"natural heritage,\" deserves real estate projects that reflect its value.\\n\\n\"We were captivated by Da Lat at first sight, and are proud to be one of the pioneering foreign investors in Da Lat\" said the representative of BTS.\\n\\nOn June 20, 2024, the Ministry of Transport issued Decision No. 758/QD-BGTVT to upgrade Lien Khuong Airport to an international airport, igniting a boom in Da Lat\\'s economy, tourism, and the entire Lam Dong province. In the first half of 2024, Lam Dong welcomed 5 million tourists, an increase of over 12%. By the end of 2024, the province is expected to receive 10 million visitors, including 550,000 international tourists. According to the 2030 plan, Lien Khuong Airport will expand to nearly 487 hectares and accommodate 5 million passengers annually, with flights from various countries worldwide.\\n\\nESG real estate is gaining traction in many developed countries and is expected to become a significant global trend in the next century. This is why the investors are partnering with The One Destination to launch a new era of ESG real estate in Vietnam, starting in Da Lat and expanding to other projects. With Vietnam\\'s dynamic economy ranking among Asia\\'s top, an average GDP growth of 6-7% annually, and a rapidly growing middle class expected to reach 40% of the population by 2030, the country\\'s real estate market is poised for a significant boom in the ESG segment. Leading companies like The One Destination will have the advantage in shaping this trend. Haus Da Lat is highly valued for its ESG-compliant design, choice of materials, construction, and operations, and focus on the human factor, aligning with the ESG goals, creating long-term value for future generations.\\n\\nCaroline Lee, Chairwoman of Terne Holdings, affirmed, \"Together with The One Destination and BTS, we will create a heritage landmark for Da Lat, Vietnam. We are proud to be among the pioneering foreign investors working alongside Vietnam\\'s real estate developers to build and preserve Da Lat in the face of the city\\'s concrete overdevelopment\".\\n\\nTerne Holdings also stated that the investment in Haus Da Lat aligns with its ongoing ESG strategy. This strategy is based on practical, measurable actions and aligns with 12 United Nations\\' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\n\\n\"The best is often saved for last, and Haus Da Lat will be Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard landmark project, a heritage for Da Lat,\" said a representative from The One Destination.

BCG\\'s analysis reveals this market growth is driven by a favorable interest rate environment -- due to higher bank revenues from accounts -- and an overall expansion of banking revenue pools.\\n\\nIn parallel, the demand for embedded finance from small-and-medium-sized businesses (SMBs) -- a sector typically underserved by traditional financial institutions -- has broadened well beyond payments. This, coupled with the market\\'s expansion, opens a significant opportunity for SaaS platforms to embed into their offerings more advanced financial products like business accounts, loans, and issued cards. Given typical margins on these products, most platforms have an opportunity to multiply their current revenues by up to three or four times.\\n\\n\"Embedding financial products creates a win-win scenario: SaaS platforms deepen user relationships and unlock new revenue streams by addressing SMBs\\' overlooked financial needs,\" says Blake Breathitt, SVP Platforms & Financial Services at Adyen. \"Our research underscores the window of opportunity for SaaS platforms to embrace embedded finance to stay competitive, or get left behind. There is an immense market opportunity here for SaaS platforms, which are in an ideal position to deliver these within their existing ecosystems.\"\\n\\nThe market is primed with strong demand from SMBs with 50% of SMBs expressing a high likelihood of utilizing a full suite of embedded finance products in the near future, reinforcing its growth potential.\\n\\n\"We are observing an appetite from SMBs to consume a broader range of financial services from within their SaaS platforms, notably loans extending beyond simple cash advances or current accounts tightly integrated in receivables and payables workflows,\" says Stefan Dab, Founder of BCG\\'s Payments and Fintech practice.\\n\\nThe report highlights that top platforms are now generating more than 50% of their revenues from embedded payments and finance, and shines a light on embedded finance as the next critical growth lever for SaaS. To differentiate in an increasingly competitive market, platforms must consider integrating financial products in their offering.\\n\\nAdyen and BCG\\'s report provides a strategic playbook for SaaS platforms looking to succeed in the embedded finance space. It outlines actionable insights on differentiating products from traditional banks, optimizing go-to-market strategies, and forming effective partnerships to drive growth.

SAN FRANCISCO , Oct. 28, 2024 /CNW/ -- Adyen , the financial technology platform of choice for leading businesses, has today launched a new report with Boston Consulting Group (BCG) which reveals a game-changing $185 billion market opportunity for SaaS platforms, a substantial 25% increase since 2022. BCG\\'s analysis reveals this market growth is driven by a favorable interest rate environment -- due to higher bank revenues from accounts -- and an overall expansion of banking revenue pools.\\n\\nIn parallel, the demand for embedded finance from small-and-medium-sized businesses (SMBs) -- a sector typically underserved by traditional financial institutions -- has broadened well beyond payments.1 This, coupled with the market\\'s expansion, opens a significant opportunity for SaaS platforms to embed into their offerings more advanced financial products like business accounts, loans, and issued cards. Given typical margins on these products, most platforms have an opportunity to multiply their current revenues by up to three or four times.\\n\\n\"Embedding financial products creates a win-win scenario: SaaS platforms deepen user relationships and unlock new revenue streams by addressing SMBs\\' overlooked financial needs,\" says Blake Breathitt , SVP Platforms & Financial Services at Adyen. \"Our research underscores the window of opportunity for SaaS platforms to embrace embedded finance to stay competitive, or get left behind.

Under the agreement, the joint venture arrangement of BTS and Terne Holdings will hold a 30% stake in The One Destination.\\n\\nThe One Destination is the developer of the Haus Da Lat project. The company is a leader in developing ESG real estate in Vietnam, actively engaged in numerous ongoing projects nationwide, and maintains a substantial land reserve. The project spans 5 hectares and has a total investment of VND 1.700 billion (~ USD 68m). It is in a prime area by the serene Xuan Huong Lake, one of Vietnam\\'s most picturesque natural lakes and a symbol of Da Lat.\\n\\nAccording to the plan, The One Destination will build Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard real estate complex on the last remaining prime land in Da Lat\\'s city center. Designed by renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, Haus Da Lat is expected to become a heritage symbol for the 130-year-old city and position Vietnam on the global ESG real estate map.\\n\\nThe decision of the international partners, to select Da Lat as their first investment destination in Vietnam highlights the city\\'s unique appeal. The partners emphasize that in a tropical country like Vietnam, Da Lat - a highland city with year-round cool weather surrounded by tranquil lakes, vast pine forests, magnificent waterfalls, and vibrant flower fields -- is a natural masterpiece. This city, often called a \"natural heritage,\" deserves real estate projects that reflect its value.\\n\\n\"We were captivated by Da Lat at first sight, and are proud to be one of the pioneering foreign investors in Da Lat\" said the representative of BTS.\\n\\nOn June 20, 2024, the Ministry of Transport issued Decision No. 758/QD-BGTVT to upgrade Lien Khuong Airport to an international airport, igniting a boom in Da Lat\\'s economy, tourism, and the entire Lam Dong province. In the first half of 2024, Lam Dong welcomed 5 million tourists, an increase of over 12%. By the end of 2024, the province is expected to receive 10 million visitors, including 550,000 international tourists. According to the 2030 plan, Lien Khuong Airport will expand to nearly 487 hectares and accommodate 5 million passengers annually, with flights from various countries worldwide.\\n\\nESG real estate is gaining traction in many developed countries and is expected to become a significant global trend in the next century. This is why the investors are partnering with The One Destination to launch a new era of ESG real estate in Vietnam, starting in Da Lat and expanding to other projects. With Vietnam\\'s dynamic economy ranking among Asia\\'s top, an average GDP growth of 6-7% annually, and a rapidly growing middle class expected to reach 40% of the population by 2030, the country\\'s real estate market is poised for a significant boom in the ESG segment. Leading companies like The One Destination will have the advantage in shaping this trend. Haus Da Lat is highly valued for its ESG-compliant design, choice of materials, construction, and operations, and focus on the human factor, aligning with the ESG goals, creating long-term value for future generations.\\n\\nCaroline Lee, Chairwoman of Terne Holdings, affirmed, \"Together with The One Destination and BTS, we will create a heritage landmark for Da Lat, Vietnam. We are proud to be among the pioneering foreign investors working alongside Vietnam\\'s real estate developers to build and preserve Da Lat in the face of the city\\'s concrete overdevelopment\".\\n\\nTerne Holdings also stated that the investment in Haus Da Lat aligns with its ongoing ESG strategy. This strategy is based on practical, measurable actions and aligns with 12 United Nations\\' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\n\\n\"The best is often saved for last, and Haus Da Lat will be Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard landmark project, a heritage for Da Lat,\" said a representative from The One Destination. Five leading international brands are also expected to join forces to create a new icon for Da Lat.\\n\\nReference Information\\n\\nThe One Destination stands at the forefront of ESG real estate development in Vietnam.

The order sought to limit the access that \"countries of concern\\'\\' -- specifically, China, Hong Kong and Macau -- have to American dollars to fund technologies that could be used, for example, to break codes or develop next-generation fighter jets. It will take effect Jan. 2.\\n\\n\"U.S. investments ... must not be used to help countries of concern develop their military, intelligence and cyber capabilities\\'\\'\\' said Paul Rosen, assistant Treasury secretary for investment security. He noted the investments can mean more than just money; they can deliver \"intangible benefits,\\'\\' including managerial help and assistance finding top talent and tapping other sources of financing.\\n\\nBlocking China\\'s high-tech ambitions is one of the few issues that enjoys broad support in Washington from both Republicans and Democrats.\\n\\nBiden in May slapped a stiff tariff on electric vehicles from China. He also has imposed export controls to keep the Chinese from acquiring advanced computer chips and the equipment to produce them. Former President Donald Trump has vowed to dramatically increase taxes on all imports from China if voters send him back to the White House.\\n\\nThe Biden administration sought comment from businesses and from U.S. allies before putting out the final version.\\n\\nIn addition to blocking investments, the rule requires Americans and companies in the United States to notify the U.S. government of transactions that involve \"technologies and products that may contribute to a threat to the national security of the United States.\\'\\'\\n\\nViolators can be hit with fines of up to $368,136 or twice the value of the prohibited transaction, whichever is greater. Treasury is setting up an Office of Global Transactions to oversee the new rule.\\n\\nIn his weekly briefing on Tuesday, Hong Kong leader John Lee said the restrictions once again reflected some U.S. politicians were undermining normal investment and trade for their political interests, and these acts would cause harm to the global supply chain. Lee said the U.S. has enjoyed a trade surplus of $472 billion with Hong Kong in the past 10 years.\\n\\n\"In pursuing their political agenda, American politicians are harming not only others but also the interests of their own country, their people and their businesses.

It will take effect Jan. 2.\\n\\n\"U.S. investments ... must not be used to help countries of concern develop their military, intelligence and cyber capabilities\\'\\'\\' said Paul Rosen, assistant Treasury secretary for investment security.

It will take effect Jan. 2.\\n\\n\"U.S. investments ... must not be used to help countries of concern develop their military, intelligence and cyber capabilities\\'\\'\\' said Paul Rosen, assistant Treasury secretary for investment security.

He also has imposed export controls to keep the Chinese from acquiring advanced computer chips and the equipment to produce them. Former President Donald Trump has vowed to dramatically increase taxes on all imports from China if voters send him back to the White House.\\n\\nThe Biden administration sought comment from businesses and from U.S. allies before putting out the final version.\\n\\nIn addition to blocking investments, the rule requires Americans and companies in the United States to notify the U.S. government of transactions that involve \"technologies and products that may contribute to a threat to the national security of the United States.\\'\\'\\n\\nViolators can be hit with fines of up to $368,136 or twice the value of the prohibited transaction, whichever is greater.

The order sought to limit the access that \"countries of concern\\'\\' -- specifically China including Hong Kong and Macao -- have to American dollars to fund technologies that could be used, for example, to break codes or develop next-generation fighter jets. It will take effect Jan. 2.\\n\\n\"U.S. investments ... must not be used to help countries of concern develop their military, intelligence and cyber capabilities\\'\\'\\' said Paul Rosen, assistant Treasury secretary for investment security.

He also has imposed export controls to keep the Chinese from acquiring advanced computer chips and the equipment to produce them. Former President Donald Trump has vowed to dramatically increase taxes on all imports from China if voters send him back to the White House.\\n\\nA Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Tuesday that the government had lodged a protest with the U.S. over the latest action.\\n\\n\"China strongly deplores and firmly opposes the U.S. rolling out restrictions on investment in China,\" Lin Jian said at a daily briefing in Beijing.\\n\\nIn Hong Kong, the city\\'s leader said the move undermined normal investment and trade and would cause damage to the global supply chain.\\n\\n\"In pursuing their political agenda, American politicians are harming not only others but also the interests of their own country, their people and their businesses. They will have to face the consequences of their actions,\" John Lee said, noting that the U.S. has enjoyed a trade surplus of $472 billion with Hong Kong in the past 10 years.\\n\\nThe Biden administration sought comment from businesses and from U.S. allies before putting out the final version.\\n\\nIn addition to blocking investments, the rule requires Americans and companies in the United States to notify the U.S. government of transactions that involve \"technologies and products that may contribute to a threat to the national security of the United States.\\'\\'', 'source': {'uri': 'ca.finance.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo!

Security debt, defined for this report as flaws that remain unfixed for longer than a year, exists in 76 percent of organizations in the financial services sector, with 50 percent of organizations carrying critical security debt.\\n\\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241029540325/en/\\n\\nFigure 1: Prevalence of security debt in the financial sector (Graphic: Business Wire)\\n\\nWith the average cost of a data breach in the financial industry estimated to be $6.08 million 1, the research comes at a critical time for one of the most highly targeted industries by sophisticated threat actors. According to a U.S. Treasury Department report in March 2024, threat actors use AI-based tools to find and exploit software vulnerabilities at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, increasing industry competition and customer expectations for convenience require organizations to accelerate innovation.\\n\\n\"The high rate of security debt in the financial sector poses significant risks to organizations and their customers if not addressed quickly. As AI-driven cyber-attacks continue to grow in strength and numbers, and organizations struggle to keep up with evolving regulations due to existing security debt, the current landscape allows threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities at an alarming, unprecedented rate,\" said Chris Wysopal, Chief Security Evangelist at Veracode. \"Our latest State of Software research highlights the critical need for financial institutions to address both first-party and third-party code vulnerabilities now. Organizations that leave flaws unremedied for longer than a year are exposed to prolonged and dangerous threats.\"\\n\\nDelayed Flaw Remediation Threatens Financial Sector Security\\n\\nVeracode researchers found 40 percent of all applications in the financial sector have security debt, which is slightly better than the cross-industry average of 42 percent. In addition, just 5.5 percent of financial sector applications are flaw-free, compared to 5.9 percent across other industries. While slightly fewer financial sector applications have security debt, they accumulate more of it.\\n\\nThe report also highlights the need for financial services organizations to address security debt in both first-party and third-party code. Eighty-four percent of all security debt affects first-party code, but the majority (78.6 percent) of critical security debt comes from third-party dependencies. This reinforces the importance of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\\'s efforts to help secure the open-source ecosystem with its Open Source Software Security Roadmap and Secure by Design Pledge.\\n\\nThe analysis further explores remediation timelines in the financial services sector. Researchers found that financial organizations fix half of first-party flaws in the first nine months, compared to 13 months for third-party flaws. Of those, 52 percent of third-party flaws turn into security debt, while 44 percent of first-party flaws turn into security debt.\\n\\nThe Importance of Prioritization in Risk Remediation\\n\\nThe proliferation of supply chain attacks targeting the financial services industry has brought about a growing number of cybersecurity regulations with a sharper focus on software security. For example, regulatory frameworks like the ISO 20022, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), NIS2, and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) require organizations to prevent vulnerabilities from being deployed in applications.\\n\\nThis puts organizations at risk of non-compliance because of existing security debt and outdated remediation strategies. Veracode\\'s research reveals that organizations can address this risk by prioritizing the 3.3% of flaws that constitute critical security debt. Remediating the most dangerous flaws first means financial entities can then move on to tackle other critical flaws or non-critical debt according to their risk tolerance and capabilities.\\n\\nThe Role of Application Security Posture Management\\n\\nThe increased need for risk prioritization creates a significant demand for Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) to continuously track risk through the collection, visibility and analysis of security issues across the software development cycle. Veracode\\'s Application Risk Management Platform provides a comprehensive, unified view of risk across code and applications, empowering developers and security teams to remediate issues swiftly. With the AI-powered solution, Veracode Fix, teams can proactively prevent new vulnerabilities and effectively reduce existing security backlogs. The platform\\'s contextual analysis uncovers root causes, guiding developers toward optimal next steps that maximize risk reduction with minimal effort.\\n\\nWysopal closed, \"It has never been more important for the financial services sector to stay ahead of evolving cybersecurity threats, particularly with increasingly sophisticated AI-driven attacks threatening the security of their assets. I urge financial institutions to prioritize timely security debt reduction by adopting AI-powered remediation and ASPM tools which can detect, prioritize and fix vulnerabilities within seconds.\"\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security Financial Services 2024 report is available to read on the Veracode website.\\n\\n1 IBM, \" Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024 \", IBM and Ponemon Institute, July 30, 2024\\n\\nAbout the State of Software Security Report\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security 2024 report analyzed data from large and small companies, commercial software suppliers, software outsourcers, and open-source projects.

Security debt, defined for this report as flaws that remain unfixed for longer than a year, exists in 76 percent of organizations in the financial services sector, with 50 percent of organizations carrying critical security debt.\\n\\nWith the average cost of a data breach in the financial industry estimated to be $6.08 million, the research comes at a critical time for one of the most highly targeted industries by sophisticated threat actors. According to a U.S. Treasury Department report in March 2024, threat actors use AI-based tools to find and exploit software vulnerabilities at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, increasing industry competition and customer expectations for convenience require organizations to accelerate innovation.\\n\\n\"The high rate of security debt in the financial sector poses significant risks to organizations and their customers if not addressed quickly. As AI-driven cyber-attacks continue to grow in strength and numbers, and organizations struggle to keep up with evolving regulations due to existing security debt, the current landscape allows threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities at an alarming, unprecedented rate,\" said Chris Wysopal, Chief Security Evangelist at Veracode. \"Our latest State of Software research highlights the critical need for financial institutions to address both first-party and third-party code vulnerabilities now. Organizations that leave flaws unremedied for longer than a year are exposed to prolonged and dangerous threats.\"\\n\\nDelayed Flaw Remediation Threatens Financial Sector Security\\n\\nVeracode researchers found 40 percent of all applications in the financial sector have security debt, which is slightly better than the cross-industry average of 42 percent. In addition, just 5.5 percent of financial sector applications are flaw-free, compared to 5.9 percent across other industries. While slightly fewer financial sector applications have security debt, they accumulate more of it.\\n\\nThe report also highlights the need for financial services organizations to address security debt in both first-party and third-party code. Eighty-four percent of all security debt affects first-party code, but the majority (78.6 percent) of critical security debt comes from third-party dependencies. This reinforces the importance of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\\'s efforts to help secure the open-source ecosystem with its Open Source Software Security Roadmap and Secure by Design Pledge.\\n\\nThe analysis further explores remediation timelines in the financial services sector. Researchers found that financial organizations fix half of first-party flaws in the first nine months, compared to 13 months for third-party flaws. Of those, 52 percent of third-party flaws turn into security debt, while 44 percent of first-party flaws turn into security debt.\\n\\nThe Importance of Prioritization in Risk Remediation\\n\\nThe proliferation of supply chain attacks targeting the financial services industry has brought about a growing number of cybersecurity regulations with a sharper focus on software security. For example, regulatory frameworks like the ISO 20022, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), NIS2, and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) require organizations to prevent vulnerabilities from being deployed in applications.\\n\\nThis puts organizations at risk of non-compliance because of existing security debt and outdated remediation strategies. Veracode\\'s research reveals that organizations can address this risk by prioritizing the 3.3% of flaws that constitute critical security debt. Remediating the most dangerous flaws first means financial entities can then move on to tackle other critical flaws or non-critical debt according to their risk tolerance and capabilities.\\n\\nThe Role of Application Security Posture Management\\n\\nThe increased need for risk prioritization creates a significant demand for Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) to continuously track risk through the collection, visibility and analysis of security issues across the software development cycle. Veracode\\'s Application Risk Management Platform provides a comprehensive, unified view of risk across code and applications, empowering developers and security teams to remediate issues swiftly. With the AI-powered solution, Veracode Fix, teams can proactively prevent new vulnerabilities and effectively reduce existing security backlogs. The platform\\'s contextual analysis uncovers root causes, guiding developers toward optimal next steps that maximize risk reduction with minimal effort.\\n\\nWysopal closed, \"It has never been more important for the financial services sector to stay ahead of evolving cybersecurity threats, particularly with increasingly sophisticated AI-driven attacks threatening the security of their assets. I urge financial institutions to prioritize timely security debt reduction by adopting AI-powered remediation and ASPM tools which can detect, prioritize and fix vulnerabilities within seconds.\"\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security Financial Services 2024 report is available to read on the Veracode website.\\n\\nIBM, \"Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024\", IBM and Ponemon Institute, July 30, 2024\\n\\nAbout the State of Software Security Report\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security 2024 report analyzed data from large and small companies, commercial software suppliers, software outsourcers, and open-source projects.

BCG\\'s analysis reveals this market growth is driven by a favorable interest rate environment -- due to higher bank revenues from accounts -- and an overall expansion of banking revenue pools.\\n\\nIn parallel, the demand for embedded finance from small-and-medium-sized businesses (SMBs) -- a sector typically underserved by traditional financial institutions -- has broadened well beyond payments. This, coupled with the market\\'s expansion, opens a significant opportunity for SaaS platforms to embed into their offerings more advanced financial products like business accounts, loans, and issued cards. Given typical margins on these products, most platforms have an opportunity to multiply their current revenues by up to three or four times.\\n\\n\"Embedding financial products creates a win-win scenario: SaaS platforms deepen user relationships and unlock new revenue streams by addressing SMBs\\' overlooked financial needs,\" says Blake Breathitt, SVP Platforms & Financial Services at Adyen. \"Our research underscores the window of opportunity for SaaS platforms to embrace embedded finance to stay competitive, or get left behind. There is an immense market opportunity here for SaaS platforms, which are in an ideal position to deliver these within their existing ecosystems.\"\\n\\nThe market is primed with strong demand from SMBs with 50% of SMBs expressing a high likelihood of utilizing a full suite of embedded finance products in the near future, reinforcing its growth potential.\\n\\n\"We are observing an appetite from SMBs to consume a broader range of financial services from within their SaaS platforms, notably loans extending beyond simple cash advances or current accounts tightly integrated in receivables and payables workflows,\" says Stefan Dab, Founder of BCG\\'s Payments and Fintech practice.\\n\\nThe report highlights that top platforms are now generating more than 50% of their revenues from embedded payments and finance, and shines a light on embedded finance as the next critical growth lever for SaaS. To differentiate in an increasingly competitive market, platforms must consider integrating financial products in their offering.\\n\\nAdyen and BCG\\'s report provides a strategic playbook for SaaS platforms looking to succeed in the embedded finance space. It outlines actionable insights on differentiating products from traditional banks, optimizing go-to-market strategies, and forming effective partnerships to drive growth.

Under the agreement, the joint venture arrangement of BTS and Terne Holdings will hold a 30% stake in The One Destination.\\n\\nThe One Destination is the developer of the Haus Da Lat project. The company is a leader in developing ESG real estate in Vietnam, actively engaged in numerous ongoing projects nationwide, and maintains a substantial land reserve. The project spans 5 hectares and has a total investment of VND 1.700 billion (~ USD 68m). It is in a prime area by the serene Xuan Huong Lake, one of Vietnam\\'s most picturesque natural lakes and a symbol of Da Lat.\\n\\nAccording to the plan, The One Destination will build Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard real estate complex on the last remaining prime land in Da Lat\\'s city center. Designed by renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, Haus Da Lat is expected to become a heritage symbol for the 130-year-old city and position Vietnam on the global ESG real estate map.\\n\\nThe decision of the international partners, to select Da Lat as their first investment destination in Vietnam highlights the city\\'s unique appeal. The partners emphasize that in a tropical country like Vietnam, Da Lat - a highland city with year-round cool weather surrounded by tranquil lakes, vast pine forests, magnificent waterfalls, and vibrant flower fields -- is a natural masterpiece. This city, often called a \"natural heritage,\" deserves real estate projects that reflect its value.\\n\\n\"We were captivated by Da Lat at first sight, and are proud to be one of the pioneering foreign investors in Da Lat\" said the representative of BTS.\\n\\nOn June 20, 2024, the Ministry of Transport issued Decision No. 758/QD-BGTVT to upgrade Lien Khuong Airport to an international airport, igniting a boom in Da Lat\\'s economy, tourism, and the entire Lam Dong province. In the first half of 2024, Lam Dong welcomed 5 million tourists, an increase of over 12%. By the end of 2024, the province is expected to receive 10 million visitors, including 550,000 international tourists. According to the 2030 plan, Lien Khuong Airport will expand to nearly 487 hectares and accommodate 5 million passengers annually, with flights from various countries worldwide.\\n\\nESG real estate is gaining traction in many developed countries and is expected to become a significant global trend in the next century. This is why the investors are partnering with The One Destination to launch a new era of ESG real estate in Vietnam, starting in Da Lat and expanding to other projects. With Vietnam\\'s dynamic economy ranking among Asia\\'s top, an average GDP growth of 6-7% annually, and a rapidly growing middle class expected to reach 40% of the population by 2030, the country\\'s real estate market is poised for a significant boom in the ESG segment. Leading companies like The One Destination will have the advantage in shaping this trend. Haus Da Lat is highly valued for its ESG-compliant design, choice of materials, construction, and operations, and focus on the human factor, aligning with the ESG goals, creating long-term value for future generations.\\n\\nCaroline Lee, Chairwoman of Terne Holdings, affirmed, \"Together with The One Destination and BTS, we will create a heritage landmark for Da Lat, Vietnam. We are proud to be among the pioneering foreign investors working alongside Vietnam\\'s real estate developers to build and preserve Da Lat in the face of the city\\'s concrete overdevelopment\".\\n\\nTerne Holdings also stated that the investment in Haus Da Lat aligns with its ongoing ESG strategy. This strategy is based on practical, measurable actions and aligns with 12 United Nations\\' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\n\\n\"The best is often saved for last, and Haus Da Lat will be Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard landmark project, a heritage for Da Lat,\" said a representative from The One Destination. Five leading international brands are also expected to join forces to create a new icon for Da Lat.\\n\\nReference Information\\n\\nThe One Destination stands at the forefront of ESG real estate development in Vietnam.

Security debt, defined for this report as flaws that remain unfixed for longer than a year, exists in 76 percent of organizations in the financial services sector, with 50 percent of organizations carrying critical security debt.\\n\\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241029540325/en/\\n\\nFigure 1: Prevalence of security debt in the financial sector (Graphic: Business Wire)\\n\\nWith the average cost of a data breach in the financial industry estimated to be $6.08 million 1, the research comes at a critical time for one of the most highly targeted industries by sophisticated threat actors. According to a U.S. Treasury Department report in March 2024, threat actors use AI-based tools to find and exploit software vulnerabilities at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, increasing industry competition and customer expectations for convenience require organizations to accelerate innovation.\\n\\n\"The high rate of security debt in the financial sector poses significant risks to organizations and their customers if not addressed quickly. As AI-driven cyber-attacks continue to grow in strength and numbers, and organizations struggle to keep up with evolving regulations due to existing security debt, the current landscape allows threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities at an alarming, unprecedented rate,\" said Chris Wysopal, Chief Security Evangelist at Veracode. \"Our latest State of Software research highlights the critical need for financial institutions to address both first-party and third-party code vulnerabilities now. Organizations that leave flaws unremedied for longer than a year are exposed to prolonged and dangerous threats.\"\\n\\nDelayed Flaw Remediation Threatens Financial Sector Security\\n\\nVeracode researchers found 40 percent of all applications in the financial sector have security debt, which is slightly better than the cross-industry average of 42 percent. In addition, just 5.5 percent of financial sector applications are flaw-free, compared to 5.9 percent across other industries. While slightly fewer financial sector applications have security debt, they accumulate more of it.\\n\\nThe report also highlights the need for financial services organizations to address security debt in both first-party and third-party code. Eighty-four percent of all security debt affects first-party code, but the majority (78.6 percent) of critical security debt comes from third-party dependencies. This reinforces the importance of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\\'s efforts to help secure the open-source ecosystem with its Open Source Software Security Roadmap and Secure by Design Pledge.\\n\\nThe analysis further explores remediation timelines in the financial services sector. Researchers found that financial organizations fix half of first-party flaws in the first nine months, compared to 13 months for third-party flaws. Of those, 52 percent of third-party flaws turn into security debt, while 44 percent of first-party flaws turn into security debt.\\n\\nThe Importance of Prioritization in Risk Remediation\\n\\nThe proliferation of supply chain attacks targeting the financial services industry has brought about a growing number of cybersecurity regulations with a sharper focus on software security. For example, regulatory frameworks like the ISO 20022, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), NIS2, and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) require organizations to prevent vulnerabilities from being deployed in applications.\\n\\nThis puts organizations at risk of non-compliance because of existing security debt and outdated remediation strategies. Veracode\\'s research reveals that organizations can address this risk by prioritizing the 3.3% of flaws that constitute critical security debt. Remediating the most dangerous flaws first means financial entities can then move on to tackle other critical flaws or non-critical debt according to their risk tolerance and capabilities.\\n\\nThe Role of Application Security Posture Management\\n\\nThe increased need for risk prioritization creates a significant demand for Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) to continuously track risk through the collection, visibility and analysis of security issues across the software development cycle. Veracode\\'s Application Risk Management Platform provides a comprehensive, unified view of risk across code and applications, empowering developers and security teams to remediate issues swiftly. With the AI-powered solution, Veracode Fix, teams can proactively prevent new vulnerabilities and effectively reduce existing security backlogs. The platform\\'s contextual analysis uncovers root causes, guiding developers toward optimal next steps that maximize risk reduction with minimal effort.\\n\\nWysopal closed, \"It has never been more important for the financial services sector to stay ahead of evolving cybersecurity threats, particularly with increasingly sophisticated AI-driven attacks threatening the security of their assets. I urge financial institutions to prioritize timely security debt reduction by adopting AI-powered remediation and ASPM tools which can detect, prioritize and fix vulnerabilities within seconds.\"\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security Financial Services 2024 report is available to read on the Veracode website.\\n\\n1 IBM, \" Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024 \", IBM and Ponemon Institute, July 30, 2024\\n\\nAbout the State of Software Security Report\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security 2024 report analyzed data from large and small companies, commercial software suppliers, software outsourcers, and open-source projects.

Security debt, defined for this report as flaws that remain unfixed for longer than a year, exists in 76 percent of organizations in the financial services sector, with 50 percent of organizations carrying critical security debt.\\n\\nWith the average cost of a data breach in the financial industry estimated to be $6.08 million, the research comes at a critical time for one of the most highly targeted industries by sophisticated threat actors. According to a U.S. Treasury Department report in March 2024, threat actors use AI-based tools to find and exploit software vulnerabilities at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, increasing industry competition and customer expectations for convenience require organizations to accelerate innovation.\\n\\n\"The high rate of security debt in the financial sector poses significant risks to organizations and their customers if not addressed quickly. As AI-driven cyber-attacks continue to grow in strength and numbers, and organizations struggle to keep up with evolving regulations due to existing security debt, the current landscape allows threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities at an alarming, unprecedented rate,\" said Chris Wysopal, Chief Security Evangelist at Veracode. \"Our latest State of Software research highlights the critical need for financial institutions to address both first-party and third-party code vulnerabilities now. Organizations that leave flaws unremedied for longer than a year are exposed to prolonged and dangerous threats.\"\\n\\nDelayed Flaw Remediation Threatens Financial Sector Security\\n\\nVeracode researchers found 40 percent of all applications in the financial sector have security debt, which is slightly better than the cross-industry average of 42 percent. In addition, just 5.5 percent of financial sector applications are flaw-free, compared to 5.9 percent across other industries. While slightly fewer financial sector applications have security debt, they accumulate more of it.\\n\\nThe report also highlights the need for financial services organizations to address security debt in both first-party and third-party code. Eighty-four percent of all security debt affects first-party code, but the majority (78.6 percent) of critical security debt comes from third-party dependencies. This reinforces the importance of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\\'s efforts to help secure the open-source ecosystem with its Open Source Software Security Roadmap and Secure by Design Pledge.\\n\\nThe analysis further explores remediation timelines in the financial services sector. Researchers found that financial organizations fix half of first-party flaws in the first nine months, compared to 13 months for third-party flaws. Of those, 52 percent of third-party flaws turn into security debt, while 44 percent of first-party flaws turn into security debt.\\n\\nThe Importance of Prioritization in Risk Remediation\\n\\nThe proliferation of supply chain attacks targeting the financial services industry has brought about a growing number of cybersecurity regulations with a sharper focus on software security. For example, regulatory frameworks like the ISO 20022, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), NIS2, and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) require organizations to prevent vulnerabilities from being deployed in applications.\\n\\nThis puts organizations at risk of non-compliance because of existing security debt and outdated remediation strategies. Veracode\\'s research reveals that organizations can address this risk by prioritizing the 3.3% of flaws that constitute critical security debt. Remediating the most dangerous flaws first means financial entities can then move on to tackle other critical flaws or non-critical debt according to their risk tolerance and capabilities.\\n\\nThe Role of Application Security Posture Management\\n\\nThe increased need for risk prioritization creates a significant demand for Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) to continuously track risk through the collection, visibility and analysis of security issues across the software development cycle. Veracode\\'s Application Risk Management Platform provides a comprehensive, unified view of risk across code and applications, empowering developers and security teams to remediate issues swiftly. With the AI-powered solution, Veracode Fix, teams can proactively prevent new vulnerabilities and effectively reduce existing security backlogs. The platform\\'s contextual analysis uncovers root causes, guiding developers toward optimal next steps that maximize risk reduction with minimal effort.\\n\\nWysopal closed, \"It has never been more important for the financial services sector to stay ahead of evolving cybersecurity threats, particularly with increasingly sophisticated AI-driven attacks threatening the security of their assets. I urge financial institutions to prioritize timely security debt reduction by adopting AI-powered remediation and ASPM tools which can detect, prioritize and fix vulnerabilities within seconds.\"\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security Financial Services 2024 report is available to read on the Veracode website.\\n\\nIBM, \"Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024\", IBM and Ponemon Institute, July 30, 2024\\n\\nAbout the State of Software Security Report\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security 2024 report analyzed data from large and small companies, commercial software suppliers, software outsourcers, and open-source projects.

Security debt, defined for this report as flaws that remain unfixed for longer than a year, exists in 76 percent of organizations in the financial services sector, with 50 percent of organizations carrying critical security debt.\\n\\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241029540325/en/\\n\\nFigure 1: Prevalence of security debt in the financial sector (Graphic: Business Wire)\\n\\nWith the average cost of a data breach in the financial industry estimated to be $6.08 million 1, the research comes at a critical time for one of the most highly targeted industries by sophisticated threat actors. According to a U.S. Treasury Department report in March 2024, threat actors use AI-based tools to find and exploit software vulnerabilities at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, increasing industry competition and customer expectations for convenience require organizations to accelerate innovation.\\n\\n\"The high rate of security debt in the financial sector poses significant risks to organizations and their customers if not addressed quickly. As AI-driven cyber-attacks continue to grow in strength and numbers, and organizations struggle to keep up with evolving regulations due to existing security debt, the current landscape allows threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities at an alarming, unprecedented rate,\" said Chris Wysopal, Chief Security Evangelist at Veracode. \"Our latest State of Software research highlights the critical need for financial institutions to address both first-party and third-party code vulnerabilities now. Organizations that leave flaws unremedied for longer than a year are exposed to prolonged and dangerous threats.\"\\n\\nDelayed Flaw Remediation Threatens Financial Sector Security\\n\\nVeracode researchers found 40 percent of all applications in the financial sector have security debt, which is slightly better than the cross-industry average of 42 percent. In addition, just 5.5 percent of financial sector applications are flaw-free, compared to 5.9 percent across other industries. While slightly fewer financial sector applications have security debt, they accumulate more of it.\\n\\nThe report also highlights the need for financial services organizations to address security debt in both first-party and third-party code. Eighty-four percent of all security debt affects first-party code, but the majority (78.6 percent) of critical security debt comes from third-party dependencies. This reinforces the importance of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\\'s efforts to help secure the open-source ecosystem with its Open Source Software Security Roadmap and Secure by Design Pledge.\\n\\nThe analysis further explores remediation timelines in the financial services sector. Researchers found that financial organizations fix half of first-party flaws in the first nine months, compared to 13 months for third-party flaws. Of those, 52 percent of third-party flaws turn into security debt, while 44 percent of first-party flaws turn into security debt.\\n\\nThe Importance of Prioritization in Risk Remediation\\n\\nThe proliferation of supply chain attacks targeting the financial services industry has brought about a growing number of cybersecurity regulations with a sharper focus on software security. For example, regulatory frameworks like the ISO 20022, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), NIS2, and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) require organizations to prevent vulnerabilities from being deployed in applications.\\n\\nThis puts organizations at risk of non-compliance because of existing security debt and outdated remediation strategies. Veracode\\'s research reveals that organizations can address this risk by prioritizing the 3.3% of flaws that constitute critical security debt. Remediating the most dangerous flaws first means financial entities can then move on to tackle other critical flaws or non-critical debt according to their risk tolerance and capabilities.\\n\\nThe Role of Application Security Posture Management\\n\\nThe increased need for risk prioritization creates a significant demand for Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) to continuously track risk through the collection, visibility and analysis of security issues across the software development cycle. Veracode\\'s Application Risk Management Platform provides a comprehensive, unified view of risk across code and applications, empowering developers and security teams to remediate issues swiftly. With the AI-powered solution, Veracode Fix, teams can proactively prevent new vulnerabilities and effectively reduce existing security backlogs. The platform\\'s contextual analysis uncovers root causes, guiding developers toward optimal next steps that maximize risk reduction with minimal effort.\\n\\nWysopal closed, \"It has never been more important for the financial services sector to stay ahead of evolving cybersecurity threats, particularly with increasingly sophisticated AI-driven attacks threatening the security of their assets. I urge financial institutions to prioritize timely security debt reduction by adopting AI-powered remediation and ASPM tools which can detect, prioritize and fix vulnerabilities within seconds.\"\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security Financial Services 2024 report is available to read on the Veracode website.\\n\\n1 IBM, \" Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024 \", IBM and Ponemon Institute, July 30, 2024\\n\\nAbout the State of Software Security Report\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security 2024 report analyzed data from large and small companies, commercial software suppliers, software outsourcers, and open-source projects.

Security debt, defined for this report as flaws that remain unfixed for longer than a year, exists in 76 percent of organizations in the financial services sector, with 50 percent of organizations carrying critical security debt.\\n\\nWith the average cost of a data breach in the financial industry estimated to be $6.08 million, the research comes at a critical time for one of the most highly targeted industries by sophisticated threat actors. According to a U.S. Treasury Department report in March 2024, threat actors use AI-based tools to find and exploit software vulnerabilities at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, increasing industry competition and customer expectations for convenience require organizations to accelerate innovation.\\n\\n\"The high rate of security debt in the financial sector poses significant risks to organizations and their customers if not addressed quickly. As AI-driven cyber-attacks continue to grow in strength and numbers, and organizations struggle to keep up with evolving regulations due to existing security debt, the current landscape allows threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities at an alarming, unprecedented rate,\" said Chris Wysopal, Chief Security Evangelist at Veracode. \"Our latest State of Software research highlights the critical need for financial institutions to address both first-party and third-party code vulnerabilities now. Organizations that leave flaws unremedied for longer than a year are exposed to prolonged and dangerous threats.\"\\n\\nDelayed Flaw Remediation Threatens Financial Sector Security\\n\\nVeracode researchers found 40 percent of all applications in the financial sector have security debt, which is slightly better than the cross-industry average of 42 percent. In addition, just 5.5 percent of financial sector applications are flaw-free, compared to 5.9 percent across other industries. While slightly fewer financial sector applications have security debt, they accumulate more of it.\\n\\nThe report also highlights the need for financial services organizations to address security debt in both first-party and third-party code. Eighty-four percent of all security debt affects first-party code, but the majority (78.6 percent) of critical security debt comes from third-party dependencies. This reinforces the importance of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\\'s efforts to help secure the open-source ecosystem with its Open Source Software Security Roadmap and Secure by Design Pledge.\\n\\nThe analysis further explores remediation timelines in the financial services sector. Researchers found that financial organizations fix half of first-party flaws in the first nine months, compared to 13 months for third-party flaws. Of those, 52 percent of third-party flaws turn into security debt, while 44 percent of first-party flaws turn into security debt.\\n\\nThe Importance of Prioritization in Risk Remediation\\n\\nThe proliferation of supply chain attacks targeting the financial services industry has brought about a growing number of cybersecurity regulations with a sharper focus on software security. For example, regulatory frameworks like the ISO 20022, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), NIS2, and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) require organizations to prevent vulnerabilities from being deployed in applications.\\n\\nThis puts organizations at risk of non-compliance because of existing security debt and outdated remediation strategies. Veracode\\'s research reveals that organizations can address this risk by prioritizing the 3.3% of flaws that constitute critical security debt. Remediating the most dangerous flaws first means financial entities can then move on to tackle other critical flaws or non-critical debt according to their risk tolerance and capabilities.\\n\\nThe Role of Application Security Posture Management\\n\\nThe increased need for risk prioritization creates a significant demand for Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) to continuously track risk through the collection, visibility and analysis of security issues across the software development cycle. Veracode\\'s Application Risk Management Platform provides a comprehensive, unified view of risk across code and applications, empowering developers and security teams to remediate issues swiftly. With the AI-powered solution, Veracode Fix, teams can proactively prevent new vulnerabilities and effectively reduce existing security backlogs. The platform\\'s contextual analysis uncovers root causes, guiding developers toward optimal next steps that maximize risk reduction with minimal effort.\\n\\nWysopal closed, \"It has never been more important for the financial services sector to stay ahead of evolving cybersecurity threats, particularly with increasingly sophisticated AI-driven attacks threatening the security of their assets. I urge financial institutions to prioritize timely security debt reduction by adopting AI-powered remediation and ASPM tools which can detect, prioritize and fix vulnerabilities within seconds.\"\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security Financial Services 2024 report is available to read on the Veracode website.\\n\\nIBM, \"Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024\", IBM and Ponemon Institute, July 30, 2024\\n\\nAbout the State of Software Security Report\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security 2024 report analyzed data from large and small companies, commercial software suppliers, software outsourcers, and open-source projects.

Under the agreement, the joint venture arrangement of BTS and Terne Holdings will hold a 30% stake in The One Destination.\\n\\nThe One Destination is the developer of the Haus Da Lat project. The company is a leader in developing ESG real estate in Vietnam, actively engaged in numerous ongoing projects nationwide, and maintains a substantial land reserve. The project spans 5 hectares and has a total investment of VND 1.700 billion (~ USD 68m). It is in a prime area by the serene Xuan Huong Lake, one of Vietnam\\'s most picturesque natural lakes and a symbol of Da Lat.\\n\\nAccording to the plan, The One Destination will build Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard real estate complex on the last remaining prime land in Da Lat\\'s city center. Designed by renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, Haus Da Lat is expected to become a heritage symbol for the 130-year-old city and position Vietnam on the global ESG real estate map.\\n\\nThe decision of the international partners, to select Da Lat as their first investment destination in Vietnam highlights the city\\'s unique appeal. The partners emphasize that in a tropical country like Vietnam, Da Lat - a highland city with year-round cool weather surrounded by tranquil lakes, vast pine forests, magnificent waterfalls, and vibrant flower fields -- is a natural masterpiece. This city, often called a \"natural heritage,\" deserves real estate projects that reflect its value.\\n\\n\"We were captivated by Da Lat at first sight, and are proud to be one of the pioneering foreign investors in Da Lat\" said the representative of BTS.\\n\\nOn June 20, 2024, the Ministry of Transport issued Decision No. 758/QD-BGTVT to upgrade Lien Khuong Airport to an international airport, igniting a boom in Da Lat\\'s economy, tourism, and the entire Lam Dong province. In the first half of 2024, Lam Dong welcomed 5 million tourists, an increase of over 12%. By the end of 2024, the province is expected to receive 10 million visitors, including 550,000 international tourists. According to the 2030 plan, Lien Khuong Airport will expand to nearly 487 hectares and accommodate 5 million passengers annually, with flights from various countries worldwide.\\n\\nESG real estate is gaining traction in many developed countries and is expected to become a significant global trend in the next century. This is why the investors are partnering with The One Destination to launch a new era of ESG real estate in Vietnam, starting in Da Lat and expanding to other projects. With Vietnam\\'s dynamic economy ranking among Asia\\'s top, an average GDP growth of 6-7% annually, and a rapidly growing middle class expected to reach 40% of the population by 2030, the country\\'s real estate market is poised for a significant boom in the ESG segment. Leading companies like The One Destination will have the advantage in shaping this trend. Haus Da Lat is highly valued for its ESG-compliant design, choice of materials, construction, and operations, and focus on the human factor, aligning with the ESG goals, creating long-term value for future generations.\\n\\nCaroline Lee, Chairwoman of Terne Holdings, affirmed, \"Together with The One Destination and BTS, we will create a heritage landmark for Da Lat, Vietnam. We are proud to be among the pioneering foreign investors working alongside Vietnam\\'s real estate developers to build and preserve Da Lat in the face of the city\\'s concrete overdevelopment\".\\n\\nTerne Holdings also stated that the investment in Haus Da Lat aligns with its ongoing ESG strategy. This strategy is based on practical, measurable actions and aligns with 12 United Nations\\' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\n\\n\"The best is often saved for last, and Haus Da Lat will be Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard landmark project, a heritage for Da Lat,\" said a representative from The One Destination. Five leading international brands are also expected to join forces to create a new icon for Da Lat.\\n\\nReference Information\\n\\nThe One Destination stands at the forefront of ESG real estate development in Vietnam. We strive to address environmental challenges, minimize our ecological footprint and enhance the local environment by employing sustainable building materials and energy-efficient technologies.\\n\\nBTS Bernina Private Equity Fund is an open-end investment company whose size exceeding USD 368 million, with 60% invested in Asia.

BCG\\'s analysis reveals this market growth is driven by a favorable interest rate environment \" due to higher bank revenues from accounts \" and an overall expansion of banking revenue pools.\\n\\nIn parallel, the demand for embedded finance from small-and-medium-sized businesses (SMBs) \" a sector typically underserved by traditional financial institutions \" has broadened well beyond payments. This, coupled with the market\\'s expansion, opens a significant opportunity for SaaS platforms to embed into their offerings more advanced financial products like business accounts, loans, and issued cards. Given typical margins on these products, most platforms have an opportunity to multiply their current revenues by up to three or four times.\\n\\n\"Embedding financial products creates a win-win scenario: SaaS platforms deepen user relationships and unlock new revenue streams by addressing SMBs\\' overlooked financial needs,\" says , SVP Platforms & Financial Services at Adyen. \"Our research underscores the window of opportunity for SaaS platforms to embrace embedded finance to stay competitive, or get left behind. There is an immense market opportunity here for SaaS platforms, which are in an ideal position to deliver these within their existing ecosystems.\"\\n\\nThe market is primed with strong demand from SMBs with 50% of SMBs expressing a high likelihood of utilizing a full suite of embedded finance products in the near future, reinforcing its growth potential.\\n\\n\"We are observing an appetite from SMBs to consume a broader range of financial services from within their SaaS platforms, notably loans extending beyond simple cash advances or current accounts tightly integrated in receivables and payables workflows,\" says Stefan Dab, Founder of BCG\\'s Payments and Fintech practice.\\n\\nThe report highlights that top platforms are now generating more than 50% of their revenues from embedded payments and finance, and shines a light on embedded finance as the next critical growth lever for SaaS. To differentiate in an increasingly competitive market, platforms must consider integrating financial products in their offering.\\n\\nAdyen and BCG\\'s report provides a strategic playbook for SaaS platforms looking to succeed in the embedded finance space. It outlines actionable insights on differentiating products from traditional banks, optimizing go-to-market strategies, and forming effective partnerships to drive growth.

Under the agreement, the joint venture arrangement of BTS and Terne Holdings will hold a 30% stake in The One Destination.\\n\\nThe One Destination is the developer of the Haus Da Lat project. The company is a leader in developing ESG real estate in Vietnam, actively engaged in numerous ongoing projects nationwide, and maintains a substantial land reserve. The project spans 5 hectares and has a total investment of VND 1.700 billion (~ USD 68m). It is in a prime area by the serene Xuan Huong Lake, one of Vietnam\\'s most picturesque natural lakes and a symbol of Da Lat.\\n\\nAccording to the plan, The One Destination will build Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard real estate complex on the last remaining prime land in Da Lat\\'s city center. Designed by renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, Haus Da Lat is expected to become a heritage symbol for the 130-year-old city and position Vietnam on the global ESG real estate map.\\n\\nThe decision of the international partners, to select Da Lat as their first investment destination in Vietnam highlights the city\\'s unique appeal. The partners emphasize that in a tropical country like Vietnam, Da Lat - a highland city with year-round cool weather surrounded by tranquil lakes, vast pine forests, magnificent waterfalls, and vibrant flower fields -- is a natural masterpiece. This city, often called a \"natural heritage,\" deserves real estate projects that reflect its value.\\n\\n\"We were captivated by Da Lat at first sight, and are proud to be one of the pioneering foreign investors in Da Lat\" said the representative of BTS.\\n\\nOn June 20, 2024, the Ministry of Transport issued Decision No. 758/QD-BGTVT to upgrade Lien Khuong Airport to an international airport, igniting a boom in Da Lat\\'s economy, tourism, and the entire Lam Dong province. In the first half of 2024, Lam Dong welcomed 5 million tourists, an increase of over 12%. By the end of 2024, the province is expected to receive 10 million visitors, including 550,000 international tourists. According to the 2030 plan, Lien Khuong Airport will expand to nearly 487 hectares and accommodate 5 million passengers annually, with flights from various countries worldwide.\\n\\nESG real estate is gaining traction in many developed countries and is expected to become a significant global trend in the next century. This is why the investors are partnering with The One Destination to launch a new era of ESG real estate in Vietnam, starting in Da Lat and expanding to other projects. With Vietnam\\'s dynamic economy ranking among Asia\\'s top, an average GDP growth of 6-7% annually, and a rapidly growing middle class expected to reach 40% of the population by 2030, the country\\'s real estate market is poised for a significant boom in the ESG segment. Leading companies like The One Destination will have the advantage in shaping this trend. Haus Da Lat is highly valued for its ESG-compliant design, choice of materials, construction, and operations, and focus on the human factor, aligning with the ESG goals, creating long-term value for future generations.\\n\\nCaroline Lee, Chairwoman of Terne Holdings, affirmed, \"Together with The One Destination and BTS, we will create a heritage landmark for Da Lat, Vietnam. We are proud to be among the pioneering foreign investors working alongside Vietnam\\'s real estate developers to build and preserve Da Lat in the face of the city\\'s concrete overdevelopment\".\\n\\nTerne Holdings also stated that the investment in Haus Da Lat aligns with its ongoing ESG strategy. This strategy is based on practical, measurable actions and aligns with 12 United Nations\\' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\n\\n\"The best is often saved for last, and Haus Da Lat will be Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard landmark project, a heritage for Da Lat,\" said a representative from The One Destination. Five leading international brands are also expected to join forces to create a new icon for Da Lat.\\n\\nReference Information\\n\\nThe One Destination stands at the forefront of ESG real estate development in Vietnam. We strive to address environmental challenges, minimize our ecological footprint and enhance the local environment by employing sustainable building materials and energy-efficient technologies.\\n\\nBTS Bernina Private Equity Fund is an open-end investment company whose size exceeding USD 368 million, with 60% invested in Asia.

BCG\\'s analysis reveals this market growth is driven by a favorable interest rate environment \" due to higher bank revenues from accounts \" and an overall expansion of banking revenue pools.\\n\\nIn parallel, the demand for embedded finance from small-and-medium-sized businesses (SMBs) \" a sector typically underserved by traditional financial institutions \" has broadened well beyond payments. This, coupled with the market\\'s expansion, opens a significant opportunity for SaaS platforms to embed into their offerings more advanced financial products like business accounts, loans, and issued cards. Given typical margins on these products, most platforms have an opportunity to multiply their current revenues by up to three or four times.\\n\\n\"Embedding financial products creates a win-win scenario: SaaS platforms deepen user relationships and unlock new revenue streams by addressing SMBs\\' overlooked financial needs,\" says , SVP Platforms & Financial Services at Adyen. \"Our research underscores the window of opportunity for SaaS platforms to embrace embedded finance to stay competitive, or get left behind. There is an immense market opportunity here for SaaS platforms, which are in an ideal position to deliver these within their existing ecosystems.\"\\n\\nThe market is primed with strong demand from SMBs with 50% of SMBs expressing a high likelihood of utilizing a full suite of embedded finance products in the near future, reinforcing its growth potential.\\n\\n\"We are observing an appetite from SMBs to consume a broader range of financial services from within their SaaS platforms, notably loans extending beyond simple cash advances or current accounts tightly integrated in receivables and payables workflows,\" says Stefan Dab, Founder of BCG\\'s Payments and Fintech practice.\\n\\nThe report highlights that top platforms are now generating more than 50% of their revenues from embedded payments and finance, and shines a light on embedded finance as the next critical growth lever for SaaS. To differentiate in an increasingly competitive market, platforms must consider integrating financial products in their offering.\\n\\nAdyen and BCG\\'s report provides a strategic playbook for SaaS platforms looking to succeed in the embedded finance space. It outlines actionable insights on differentiating products from traditional banks, optimizing go-to-market strategies, and forming effective partnerships to drive growth.

Security debt, defined for this report as flaws that remain unfixed for longer than a year, exists in 76 percent of organizations in the financial services sector, with 50 percent of organizations carrying critical security debt.\\n\\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241029540325/en/\\n\\nFigure 1: Prevalence of security debt in the financial sector (Graphic: Business Wire)\\n\\nWith the average cost of a data breach in the financial industry estimated to be $6.08 million 1, the research comes at a critical time for one of the most highly targeted industries by sophisticated threat actors. According to a U.S. Treasury Department report in March 2024, threat actors use AI-based tools to find and exploit software vulnerabilities at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, increasing industry competition and customer expectations for convenience require organizations to accelerate innovation.\\n\\n\"The high rate of security debt in the financial sector poses significant risks to organizations and their customers if not addressed quickly. As AI-driven cyber-attacks continue to grow in strength and numbers, and organizations struggle to keep up with evolving regulations due to existing security debt, the current landscape allows threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities at an alarming, unprecedented rate,\" said Chris Wysopal, Chief Security Evangelist at Veracode. \"Our latest State of Software research highlights the critical need for financial institutions to address both first-party and third-party code vulnerabilities now. Organizations that leave flaws unremedied for longer than a year are exposed to prolonged and dangerous threats.\"\\n\\nDelayed Flaw Remediation Threatens Financial Sector Security\\n\\nVeracode researchers found 40 percent of all applications in the financial sector have security debt, which is slightly better than the cross-industry average of 42 percent. In addition, just 5.5 percent of financial sector applications are flaw-free, compared to 5.9 percent across other industries. While slightly fewer financial sector applications have security debt, they accumulate more of it.\\n\\nThe report also highlights the need for financial services organizations to address security debt in both first-party and third-party code. Eighty-four percent of all security debt affects first-party code, but the majority (78.6 percent) of critical security debt comes from third-party dependencies. This reinforces the importance of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\\'s efforts to help secure the open-source ecosystem with its Open Source Software Security Roadmap and Secure by Design Pledge.\\n\\nThe analysis further explores remediation timelines in the financial services sector. Researchers found that financial organizations fix half of first-party flaws in the first nine months, compared to 13 months for third-party flaws. Of those, 52 percent of third-party flaws turn into security debt, while 44 percent of first-party flaws turn into security debt.\\n\\nThe Importance of Prioritization in Risk Remediation\\n\\nThe proliferation of supply chain attacks targeting the financial services industry has brought about a growing number of cybersecurity regulations with a sharper focus on software security. For example, regulatory frameworks like the ISO 20022, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), NIS2, and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) require organizations to prevent vulnerabilities from being deployed in applications.\\n\\nThis puts organizations at risk of non-compliance because of existing security debt and outdated remediation strategies. Veracode\\'s research reveals that organizations can address this risk by prioritizing the 3.3% of flaws that constitute critical security debt. Remediating the most dangerous flaws first means financial entities can then move on to tackle other critical flaws or non-critical debt according to their risk tolerance and capabilities.\\n\\nThe Role of Application Security Posture Management\\n\\nThe increased need for risk prioritization creates a significant demand for Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) to continuously track risk through the collection, visibility and analysis of security issues across the software development cycle. Veracode\\'s Application Risk Management Platform provides a comprehensive, unified view of risk across code and applications, empowering developers and security teams to remediate issues swiftly. With the AI-powered solution, Veracode Fix, teams can proactively prevent new vulnerabilities and effectively reduce existing security backlogs. The platform\\'s contextual analysis uncovers root causes, guiding developers toward optimal next steps that maximize risk reduction with minimal effort.\\n\\nWysopal closed, \"It has never been more important for the financial services sector to stay ahead of evolving cybersecurity threats, particularly with increasingly sophisticated AI-driven attacks threatening the security of their assets. I urge financial institutions to prioritize timely security debt reduction by adopting AI-powered remediation and ASPM tools which can detect, prioritize and fix vulnerabilities within seconds.\"\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security Financial Services 2024 report is available to read on the Veracode website.\\n\\n1 IBM, \" Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024 \", IBM and Ponemon Institute, July 30, 2024\\n\\nAbout the State of Software Security Report\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security 2024 report analyzed data from large and small companies, commercial software suppliers, software outsourcers, and open-source projects.

Security debt, defined for this report as flaws that remain unfixed for longer than a year, exists in 76 percent of organizations in the financial services sector, with 50 percent of organizations carrying critical security debt.\\n\\nWith the average cost of a data breach in the financial industry estimated to be $6.08 million, the research comes at a critical time for one of the most highly targeted industries by sophisticated threat actors. According to a U.S. Treasury Department report in March 2024, threat actors use AI-based tools to find and exploit software vulnerabilities at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, increasing industry competition and customer expectations for convenience require organizations to accelerate innovation.\\n\\n\"The high rate of security debt in the financial sector poses significant risks to organizations and their customers if not addressed quickly. As AI-driven cyber-attacks continue to grow in strength and numbers, and organizations struggle to keep up with evolving regulations due to existing security debt, the current landscape allows threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities at an alarming, unprecedented rate,\" said Chris Wysopal, Chief Security Evangelist at Veracode. \"Our latest State of Software research highlights the critical need for financial institutions to address both first-party and third-party code vulnerabilities now. Organizations that leave flaws unremedied for longer than a year are exposed to prolonged and dangerous threats.\"\\n\\nDelayed Flaw Remediation Threatens Financial Sector Security\\n\\nVeracode researchers found 40 percent of all applications in the financial sector have security debt, which is slightly better than the cross-industry average of 42 percent. In addition, just 5.5 percent of financial sector applications are flaw-free, compared to 5.9 percent across other industries. While slightly fewer financial sector applications have security debt, they accumulate more of it.\\n\\nThe report also highlights the need for financial services organizations to address security debt in both first-party and third-party code. Eighty-four percent of all security debt affects first-party code, but the majority (78.6 percent) of critical security debt comes from third-party dependencies. This reinforces the importance of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\\'s efforts to help secure the open-source ecosystem with its Open Source Software Security Roadmap and Secure by Design Pledge.\\n\\nThe analysis further explores remediation timelines in the financial services sector. Researchers found that financial organizations fix half of first-party flaws in the first nine months, compared to 13 months for third-party flaws. Of those, 52 percent of third-party flaws turn into security debt, while 44 percent of first-party flaws turn into security debt.\\n\\nThe Importance of Prioritization in Risk Remediation\\n\\nThe proliferation of supply chain attacks targeting the financial services industry has brought about a growing number of cybersecurity regulations with a sharper focus on software security. For example, regulatory frameworks like the ISO 20022, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), NIS2, and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) require organizations to prevent vulnerabilities from being deployed in applications.\\n\\nThis puts organizations at risk of non-compliance because of existing security debt and outdated remediation strategies. Veracode\\'s research reveals that organizations can address this risk by prioritizing the 3.3% of flaws that constitute critical security debt. Remediating the most dangerous flaws first means financial entities can then move on to tackle other critical flaws or non-critical debt according to their risk tolerance and capabilities.\\n\\nThe Role of Application Security Posture Management\\n\\nThe increased need for risk prioritization creates a significant demand for Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) to continuously track risk through the collection, visibility and analysis of security issues across the software development cycle. Veracode\\'s Application Risk Management Platform provides a comprehensive, unified view of risk across code and applications, empowering developers and security teams to remediate issues swiftly. With the AI-powered solution, Veracode Fix, teams can proactively prevent new vulnerabilities and effectively reduce existing security backlogs. The platform\\'s contextual analysis uncovers root causes, guiding developers toward optimal next steps that maximize risk reduction with minimal effort.\\n\\nWysopal closed, \"It has never been more important for the financial services sector to stay ahead of evolving cybersecurity threats, particularly with increasingly sophisticated AI-driven attacks threatening the security of their assets. I urge financial institutions to prioritize timely security debt reduction by adopting AI-powered remediation and ASPM tools which can detect, prioritize and fix vulnerabilities within seconds.\"\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security Financial Services 2024 report is available to read on the Veracode website.\\n\\nIBM, \"Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024\", IBM and Ponemon Institute, July 30, 2024\\n\\nAbout the State of Software Security Report\\n\\nThe Veracode State of Software Security 2024 report analyzed data from large and small companies, commercial software suppliers, software outsourcers, and open-source projects.

Under the agreement, the joint venture arrangement of BTS and Terne Holdings will hold a 30% stake in The One Destination.\\n\\nThe One Destination is the developer of the Haus Da Lat project. The company is a leader in developing ESG real estate in Vietnam, actively engaged in numerous ongoing projects nationwide, and maintains a substantial land reserve. The project spans 5 hectares and has a total investment of VND 1.700 billion (~ USD 68m). It is in a prime area by the serene Xuan Huong Lake, one of Vietnam\\'s most picturesque natural lakes and a symbol of Da Lat.\\n\\nAccording to the plan, The One Destination will build Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard real estate complex on the last remaining prime land in Da Lat\\'s city center. Designed by renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, Haus Da Lat is expected to become a heritage symbol for the 130-year-old city and position Vietnam on the global ESG real estate map.\\n\\nThe decision of the international partners, to select Da Lat as their first investment destination in Vietnam highlights the city\\'s unique appeal. The partners emphasize that in a tropical country like Vietnam, Da Lat - a highland city with year-round cool weather surrounded by tranquil lakes, vast pine forests, magnificent waterfalls, and vibrant flower fields -- is a natural masterpiece. This city, often called a \"natural heritage,\" deserves real estate projects that reflect its value.\\n\\n\"We were captivated by Da Lat at first sight, and are proud to be one of the pioneering foreign investors in Da Lat\" said the representative of BTS.\\n\\nOn June 20, 2024, the Ministry of Transport issued Decision No. 758/QD-BGTVT to upgrade Lien Khuong Airport to an international airport, igniting a boom in Da Lat\\'s economy, tourism, and the entire Lam Dong province. In the first half of 2024, Lam Dong welcomed 5 million tourists, an increase of over 12%. By the end of 2024, the province is expected to receive 10 million visitors, including 550,000 international tourists. According to the 2030 plan, Lien Khuong Airport will expand to nearly 487 hectares and accommodate 5 million passengers annually, with flights from various countries worldwide.\\n\\nESG real estate is gaining traction in many developed countries and is expected to become a significant global trend in the next century. This is why the investors are partnering with The One Destination to launch a new era of ESG real estate in Vietnam, starting in Da Lat and expanding to other projects. With Vietnam\\'s dynamic economy ranking among Asia\\'s top, an average GDP growth of 6-7% annually, and a rapidly growing middle class expected to reach 40% of the population by 2030, the country\\'s real estate market is poised for a significant boom in the ESG segment. Leading companies like The One Destination will have the advantage in shaping this trend. Haus Da Lat is highly valued for its ESG-compliant design, choice of materials, construction, and operations, and focus on the human factor, aligning with the ESG goals, creating long-term value for future generations.\\n\\nCaroline Lee, Chairwoman of Terne Holdings, affirmed, \"Together with The One Destination and BTS, we will create a heritage landmark for Da Lat, Vietnam. We are proud to be among the pioneering foreign investors working alongside Vietnam\\'s real estate developers to build and preserve Da Lat in the face of the city\\'s concrete overdevelopment\".\\n\\nTerne Holdings also stated that the investment in Haus Da Lat aligns with its ongoing ESG strategy. This strategy is based on practical, measurable actions and aligns with 12 United Nations\\' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\n\\n\"The best is often saved for last, and Haus Da Lat will be Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard landmark project, a heritage for Da Lat,\" said a representative from The One Destination.

BCG\\'s analysis reveals this market growth is driven by a favorable interest rate environment \" due to higher bank revenues from accounts \" and an overall expansion of banking revenue pools.\\n\\nIn parallel, the demand for embedded finance from small-and-medium-sized businesses (SMBs) \" a sector typically underserved by traditional financial institutions \" has broadened well beyond payments. This, coupled with the market\\'s expansion, opens a significant opportunity for SaaS platforms to embed into their offerings more advanced financial products like business accounts, loans, and issued cards. Given typical margins on these products, most platforms have an opportunity to multiply their current revenues by up to three or four times.\\n\\n\"Embedding financial products creates a win-win scenario: SaaS platforms deepen user relationships and unlock new revenue streams by addressing SMBs\\' overlooked financial needs,\" says , SVP Platforms & Financial Services at Adyen. \"Our research underscores the window of opportunity for SaaS platforms to embrace embedded finance to stay competitive, or get left behind. There is an immense market opportunity here for SaaS platforms, which are in an ideal position to deliver these within their existing ecosystems.\"\\n\\nThe market is primed with strong demand from SMBs with 50% of SMBs expressing a high likelihood of utilizing a full suite of embedded finance products in the near future, reinforcing its growth potential.\\n\\n\"We are observing an appetite from SMBs to consume a broader range of financial services from within their SaaS platforms, notably loans extending beyond simple cash advances or current accounts tightly integrated in receivables and payables workflows,\" says Stefan Dab, Founder of BCG\\'s Payments and Fintech practice.\\n\\nThe report highlights that top platforms are now generating more than 50% of their revenues from embedded payments and finance, and shines a light on embedded finance as the next critical growth lever for SaaS. To differentiate in an increasingly competitive market, platforms must consider integrating financial products in their offering.\\n\\nAdyen and BCG\\'s report provides a strategic playbook for SaaS platforms looking to succeed in the embedded finance space. It outlines actionable insights on differentiating products from traditional banks, optimizing go-to-market strategies, and forming effective partnerships to drive growth.

The order sought to limit the access that \"countries of concern\\'\\' -- specifically, China, Hong Kong and Macau -- have to American dollars to fund technologies that could be used, for example, to break codes or develop next-generation fighter jets. It will take effect Jan. 2.\\n\\n\"U.S. investments ... must not be used to help countries of concern develop their military, intelligence and cyber capabilities\\'\\'\\' said Paul Rosen, assistant Treasury secretary for investment security.

He also has imposed export controls to keep the Chinese from acquiring advanced computer chips and the equipment to produce them. Former President Donald Trump has vowed to dramatically increase taxes on all imports from China if voters send him back to the White House.\\n\\nThe Biden administration sought comment from businesses and from U.S. allies before putting out the final version.\\n\\nIn addition to blocking investments, the rule requires Americans and companies in the United States to notify the U.S. government of transactions that involve \"technologies and products that may contribute to a threat to the national security of the United States.\\'\\'\\n\\nViolators can be hit with fines of up to $368,136 or twice the value of the prohibited transaction, whichever is greater.

It\\'s coming off a 4.7% spurt last week spurred by Donald Trump\\'s presidential victory and a cut to interest rates by the Federal Reserve to bolster the economy.\\n\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 400 points, or 0.9%, as of 10:15 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.1% lower.\\n\\nTesla was the strongest force pushing the S&P 500 higher after rising 6.9%. Its leader, Elon Musk, has become a close ally of Trump\\'s, and its stock jumped nearly 15% the day after the election and has kept rising.\\n\\nSeveral pieces of what\\'s known as the \"Trump trade\" also helped drive the market, as investors try to identify which kinds of companies will be winners under a second Trump term. JPMorgan Chase rose 1.9%, and bank stocks broadly continue to benefit from expectations for stronger economic growth, less regulation from Washington and an increase in mergers and acquisitions.\\n\\nA White House more friendly to big tie-ups has helped Wall Street speculate about a merger between insurers Cigna Group and Humana, for example. It\\'s been so feverish that Cigna said Monday it isn\\'t pursuing a deal with Humana. Cigna\\'s stock rose 6.5%, and Humana\\'s sank 4.9%.\\n\\nStocks of companies more focused on the U.S. economy were also rising more than the rest of the market, including a 1% rally for the smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index, because they\\'re seen as benefiting more from Trump\\'s America First policies than big multinational companies.\\n\\nCompanies are also continuing to deliver earnings reports showing they made more in profit during the summer than analysts expected. Aramark gained 2.2% after it reported broad-based growth during the latest quarter, including for food at stadiums and among customers around the world.\\n\\nThey helped offset a drop of 1.7% for Nvidia, which was the heaviest weight on the market and helped drag the Nasdaq composite in particular.\\n\\nAbbVie tumbled 13.1% after saying trials investigating its treatment for some adults with schizophrenia failed to show statistically significant improvement compared with a placebo group at week six.\\n\\nSome of the sharpest swings were in the crypto market, where bitcoin rose above $82,000 for the first time. Trump has embraced cryptocurrencies generally and pledged to make his country the crypto capital of the world. Bitcoin hit a record of $82,493 in early trading, according to CoinDesk.\\n\\nAnother Trump trade has been a rise in Treasury yields, as traders anticipate potentially higher economic growth, U.S. government debt and inflation because of Trump\\'s policies. But trading in the bond market is closed Monday in observance of Veterans Day.\\n\\nTreasury yields been generally climbing since September, in large part because the U.S. economy has remained much more resilient than feared. The hope is that it can continue to stay solid as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in order to keep the job market humming, now that it\\'s helped get inflation nearly down to its 2% target.\\n\\nBut Trump\\'s win has scrambled expectations for coming cuts to rates.

It\\'s coming off a 4.7% spurt last week spurred by Donald Trump\\'s presidential victory and a cut to interest rates by the Federal Reserve to bolster the economy.\\n\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 400 points, or 0.9%, as of 10:15 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.1% lower.\\n\\nTesla was the strongest force pushing the S&P 500 higher after rising 6.9%. Its leader, Elon Musk, has become a close ally of Trump\\'s, and its stock jumped nearly 15% the day after the election and has kept rising.\\n\\nSeveral pieces of what\\'s known as the \"Trump trade\" also helped drive the market, as investors try to identify which kinds of companies will be winners under a second Trump term. JPMorgan Chase rose 1.9%, and bank stocks broadly continue to benefit from expectations for stronger economic growth, less regulation from Washington and an increase in mergers and acquisitions.\\n\\nA White House more friendly to big tie-ups has helped Wall Street speculate about a merger between insurers Cigna Group and Humana, for example. It\\'s been so feverish that Cigna said Monday it isn\\'t pursuing a deal with Humana. Cigna\\'s stock rose 6.5%, and Humana\\'s sank 4.9%.\\n\\nStocks of companies more focused on the U.S. economy were also rising more than the rest of the market, including a 1% rally for the smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index, because they\\'re seen as benefiting more from Trump\\'s America First policies than big multinational companies.\\n\\nCompanies are also continuing to deliver earnings reports showing they made more in profit during the summer than analysts expected. Aramark gained 2.2% after it reported broad-based growth during the latest quarter, including for food at stadiums and among customers around the world.\\n\\nThey helped offset a drop of 1.7% for Nvidia, which was the heaviest weight on the market and helped drag the Nasdaq composite in particular.\\n\\nAbbVie tumbled 13.1% after saying trials investigating its treatment for some adults with schizophrenia failed to show statistically significant improvement compared with a placebo group at week six.\\n\\nSome of the sharpest swings were in the crypto market, where bitcoin rose above $82,000 for the first time. Trump has embraced cryptocurrencies generally and pledged to make his country the crypto capital of the world. Bitcoin hit a record of $82,493 in early trading, according to CoinDesk.\\n\\nAnother Trump trade has been a rise in Treasury yields, as traders anticipate potentially higher economic growth, U.S. government debt and inflation because of Trump\\'s policies. But trading in the bond market is closed Monday in observance of Veterans Day.\\n\\nTreasury yields been generally climbing since September, in large part because the U.S. economy has remained much more resilient than feared. The hope is that it can continue to stay solid as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in order to keep the job market humming, now that it\\'s helped get inflation nearly down to its 2% target.\\n\\nBut Trump\\'s win has scrambled expectations for coming cuts to rates. Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many the Fed will deliver next year. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel.\\n\\nStock markets abroad have swung following Trump\\'s election amid worries about increased tariffs and disruptions to global trade.\\n\\nIndexes were mixed Monday, with European markets rising while South Korea\\'s and Hong Kong\\'s sank.\\n\\nAP Writer Zimo Zhong in Hong Kong contributed to this report.', 'source': {'uri': 'register-herald.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Beckley Register-Herald'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'stan_choe@register-herald.com', 'name': 'Stan Choe', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/22/e223a9ae-3c81-50c9-8099-4b724ef80dae/67317e47d185b.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-10076908', 'sentiment': 0.2313725490196079, 'wgt': 251, 'relevance': 9}, {'uri': '2024-10-525364755', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-10-25', 'time': '00:14:16', 'dateTime': '2024-10-25T00:14:16Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-10-24T19:29:00Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9803921580314636, 'url': 'https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2024-10-24/microsoft-ceo-nadellas-2024-pay-rose-63-to-79-million-on-stock-awards', 'title': \"Microsoft CEO Nadella's 2024 Pay Rose 63% to $79 Million on Stock Awards\", 'body': \"(Reuters) - Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's fiscal 2024 compensation surged 63% to $79.1 million, according to a filing on Thursday, helped by his stock awards in a year when the tech behemoth's market value breached $3 trillion.\\n\\nStock awards for Nadella, who earned $48.5 million in 2023, climbed to about $71 million from $39 million a year earlier.\\n\\nMicrosoft's shares had gained about 31.2% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\\n\\nBacked by its investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Microsoft is widely seen as a frontrunner in the race for market dominance in the rollout of generative artificial intelligence (AI) among other tech heavyweights.\\n\\nHowever, Nadella's cash incentive of $5.2 million was less than the $10.7 million he was eligible for as he asked for a reduction following multiple cybersecurity breaches reported during the fiscal year, according to the filing.\\n\\nAmong other high-profile tech bosses, Apple's CEO Tim Cook earned $63.2 million in 2023.\\n\\nAI-chip giant Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang's payout was $34.2 million in fiscal 2024.\\n\\n(Reporting by Sourasis Bose in Bengaluru;

BCG\\'s analysis reveals this market growth is driven by a favorable interest rate environment -- due to higher bank revenues from accounts -- and an overall expansion of banking revenue pools.\\n\\nIn parallel, the demand for embedded finance from small-and-medium-sized businesses (SMBs) -- a sector typically underserved by traditional financial institutions -- has broadened well beyond payments. This, coupled with the market\\'s expansion, opens a significant opportunity for SaaS platforms to embed into their offerings more advanced financial products like business accounts, loans, and issued cards. Given typical margins on these products, most platforms have an opportunity to multiply their current revenues by up to three or four times.\\n\\n\"Embedding financial products creates a win-win scenario: SaaS platforms deepen user relationships and unlock new revenue streams by addressing SMBs\\' overlooked financial needs,\" says Blake Breathitt, SVP Platforms & Financial Services at Adyen. \"Our research underscores the window of opportunity for SaaS platforms to embrace embedded finance to stay competitive, or get left behind. There is an immense market opportunity here for SaaS platforms, which are in an ideal position to deliver these within their existing ecosystems.\"\\n\\nThe market is primed with strong demand from SMBs with 50% of SMBs expressing a high likelihood of utilizing a full suite of embedded finance products in the near future, reinforcing its growth potential.\\n\\n\"We are observing an appetite from SMBs to consume a broader range of financial services from within their SaaS platforms, notably loans extending beyond simple cash advances or current accounts tightly integrated in receivables and payables workflows,\" says Stefan Dab, Founder of BCG\\'s Payments and Fintech practice.\\n\\nThe report highlights that top platforms are now generating more than 50% of their revenues from embedded payments and finance, and shines a light on embedded finance as the next critical growth lever for SaaS. To differentiate in an increasingly competitive market, platforms must consider integrating financial products in their offering.\\n\\nAdyen and BCG\\'s report provides a strategic playbook for SaaS platforms looking to succeed in the embedded finance space. It outlines actionable insights on differentiating products from traditional banks, optimizing go-to-market strategies, and forming effective partnerships to drive growth.

The event attracted significant attention to XTransfer\\'s booth, where attendees learned about the company\\'s innovation for secure and speedy global trade payments for SMEs. Bill Deng, Founder and CEO of XTransfer, participated in multiple panel discussions, engaged with leaders from international financial institutions and attended private meetings with various government representatives to explore collaboration opportunities.\\n\\nBill was invited to be the keynote speaker for the \"Next-Gen Digital Payment Infrastructure: Integration, Security & Interoperability\" panel on the first day of the event, which included representatives from Tencent Financial Technology and Payment Asia.\\n\\nDuring his discussion on how AI and other emerging technologies can enhance the efficiency and security of payments, Bill stated, \"XTransfer has built a data-based, automated, Internet-based and intelligent anti-money laundering risk control infrastructure centred on SMEs. By utilising artificial intelligence to assist banks and financial institutions in anti-money laundering and anti-fraud efforts, manual operations are largely reduced, significantly improving efficiency. XTransfer uses technology as a bridge to link large financial institutions and SMEs around the world, allowing them to enjoy the same level of cross-border financial services as large multinational corporations.\"\\n\\nBill was also invited to participate in another panel on \"The Role of Tech in Finance for an Inclusive Future\", where he addressed the topic of promoting financial inclusion. Bill remarked, \"With the increasingly stringent rules and regulations imposed by various governments, SMEs have continued to encounter various obstacles in trade settlement, including difficulties in opening accounts with traditional banks, high risk of fund freezing, high exchange losses, long remittance time, high remittance costs, and even being forced to remit funds through non-compliant channels.\"\\n\\n\"Today, banks, financial institutions, and fintech payment companies have begun to cooperate to find efficient solutions to serve SMEs and enhance financial inclusion. XTransfer has partnered with J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Bank of China, DBS Bank, Visa, and other international banks and financial institutions to provide SMEs engaged in foreign trade with the \"Global Business Account\". The account covers more than 200 countries/regions and more than 15 currencies, offering cross-border payment solutions, foreign exchange, and other financial services,\" Bill added.\\n\\nWhen discussing XTransfer\\'s global expansion, Bill said, \"We have observed that emerging countries, particularly those in the ASEAN region, Africa, and South America, are experiencing a rise in cross-border trade. However, SMEs in these emerging markets often encounter challenges, such as being \"unbanked\" and lacking access to US dollars.\"\\n\\n\"XTransfer is actively expanding into emerging markets such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East; Nigeria and Kenya in Africa; Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines in Southeast Asia; as well as Mexico and Brazil in South America. When both buyer and seller use an XTransfer account, they can utilise the XTransfer-to-XTransfer (X2X) payment service, which allows them to conduct \"Account-to-Account\" payments, enabling seamless transactions between the buyer and seller as if they were making a \"local transfer\". This significantly improves operational capital efficiency for enterprises and promotes global trade.\" Bill added\\n\\nFinally, Bill pointed out, \"In our first six years, we have been focusing on the Mainland China market, assisting SMEs with their foreign trade collection needs. In 2023, we took our first step toward global expansion by entering the Hong Kong market. This year, we participated in the Hong Kong FinTech Week for the first time, and it was incredibly rewarding. We not only broadened our horizons but also showcased our strengths to industry and the public.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241031095658/en/\\n\\nThrough this partnership, ANEXT Bank will expand its product suite to include a selection of investment funds managed by Schroders, offering MSMEs more opportunities to grow their wealth alongside ANEXT Fixed Deposit, the bank\\'s existing investment product. The first fund from Schroders is expected to be available through ANEXT Bank by 1Q 2025, subject to regulatory approval.\\n\\nOver 30% of ANEXT Bank\\'s customers are Foreign Business Owners (FBOs) from 78 nationalities, operating businesses incorporated in Singapore, while 69% are micro businesses. This expanded offering will allow a diverse global community of MSMEs to manage and grow funds with greater flexibility, while ensuring cash flow liquidity with no lock-in period required.\\n\\nDespite the wide availability of financial products, many small business owners find it challenging to start investing due to high entry barriers and limited financial literacy. According to a recent survey1 conducted by ANEXT Bank, four in five MSMEs have never purchased investment instruments. The top three barriers cited were a lack of excess liquidity, insufficient investment know-how, and limited suitable investment options.\\n\\nMs Eileen Chan, Director at Premium Orchids Singapore echoes the sentiment on investments: \"As a small business owner, investing has never really been on my radar because I always thought it was only for larger companies with substantial capital. With ANEXT Bank\\'s new investment offerings, I\\'m excited about the opportunity to grow my bank balance, even with small amounts. For businesses like mine, every cent counts. This initiative also spares me the hassle of navigating the complexities of different investment options, allowing me to focus on running my business.\"\\n\\nThe partnership between ANEXT Bank and Schroders is designed to make investments more inclusive, catering to the needs of small businesses. By leveraging secure APIs to facilitate seamless integration between ANEXT Bank\\'s online banking platform and Schroders\\' products, the collaboration allows ANEXT Bank customers to conveniently access, manage, and track their investments directly within the platform.\\n\\nANEXT Bank and Schroders will also explore innovation to enhance investment access for MSMEs through asset tokenisation as well as sustainable investment solutions, supporting their sustainability journey. In addition, the two companies will collaborate to promote financial literacy among MSMEs, helping them better understand investments and wealth management, thereby lowering barriers to entry.\\n\\n\"The partnership with Schroders marks a significant milestone for ANEXT Bank as our first collaboration with a global partner. By combining the strengths of both companies, we are bringing greater value to MSMEs by making high-quality investment products more accessible and opening up the world of financial growth to small businesses. Leveraging Schroders\\' leadership and decades of expertise in the investment space, alongside ANEXT Bank\\'s insights into MSMEs and tech-driven innovation, we are excited to take a holistic approach to driving financial inclusion. This includes not only offering innovative products but also providing knowledge and capacity-building to making financial services more inclusive and accessible to micro and growing businesses,\" said Ms Toh Su Mei, CEO of ANEXT Bank.\\n\\n\"MSMEs are the backbone of Singapore\\'s economy, comprising 99% of its enterprises. We are excited to partner with ANEXT Bank to better serve this dynamic client segment.

BCG\\'s analysis reveals this market growth is driven by a favorable interest rate environment -- due to higher bank revenues from accounts -- and an overall expansion of banking revenue pools.\\n\\nIn parallel, the demand for embedded finance from small-and-medium-sized businesses (SMBs) -- a sector typically underserved by traditional financial institutions -- has broadened well beyond payments. This, coupled with the market\\'s expansion, opens a significant opportunity for SaaS platforms to embed into their offerings more advanced financial products like business accounts, loans, and issued cards. Given typical margins on these products, most platforms have an opportunity to multiply their current revenues by up to three or four times.\\n\\n\"Embedding financial products creates a win-win scenario: SaaS platforms deepen user relationships and unlock new revenue streams by addressing SMBs\\' overlooked financial needs,\" says Blake Breathitt, SVP Platforms & Financial Services at Adyen. \"Our research underscores the window of opportunity for SaaS platforms to embrace embedded finance to stay competitive, or get left behind. There is an immense market opportunity here for SaaS platforms, which are in an ideal position to deliver these within their existing ecosystems.\"\\n\\nThe market is primed with strong demand from SMBs with 50% of SMBs expressing a high likelihood of utilizing a full suite of embedded finance products in the near future, reinforcing its growth potential.\\n\\n\"We are observing an appetite from SMBs to consume a broader range of financial services from within their SaaS platforms, notably loans extending beyond simple cash advances or current accounts tightly integrated in receivables and payables workflows,\" says Stefan Dab, Founder of BCG\\'s Payments and Fintech practice.\\n\\nThe report highlights that top platforms are now generating more than 50% of their revenues from embedded payments and finance, and shines a light on embedded finance as the next critical growth lever for SaaS. To differentiate in an increasingly competitive market, platforms must consider integrating financial products in their offering.\\n\\nAdyen and BCG\\'s report provides a strategic playbook for SaaS platforms looking to succeed in the embedded finance space. It outlines actionable insights on differentiating products from traditional banks, optimizing go-to-market strategies, and forming effective partnerships to drive growth.

The event attracted significant attention to XTransfer\\'s booth, where attendees learned about the company\\'s innovation for secure and speedy global trade payments for SMEs. Bill Deng, Founder and CEO of XTransfer, participated in multiple panel discussions, engaged with leaders from international financial institutions and attended private meetings with various government representatives to explore collaboration opportunities.\\n\\nBill was invited to be the keynote speaker for the \"Next-Gen Digital Payment Infrastructure: Integration, Security & Interoperability\" panel on the first day of the event, which included representatives from Tencent Financial Technology and Payment Asia.\\n\\nDuring his discussion on how AI and other emerging technologies can enhance the efficiency and security of payments, Bill stated, \"XTransfer has built a data-based, automated, Internet-based and intelligent anti-money laundering risk control infrastructure centred on SMEs. By utilising artificial intelligence to assist banks and financial institutions in anti-money laundering and anti-fraud efforts, manual operations are largely reduced, significantly improving efficiency. XTransfer uses technology as a bridge to link large financial institutions and SMEs around the world, allowing them to enjoy the same level of cross-border financial services as large multinational corporations.\"\\n\\nBill was also invited to participate in another panel on \"The Role of Tech in Finance for an Inclusive Future\", where he addressed the topic of promoting financial inclusion. Bill remarked, \"With the increasingly stringent rules and regulations imposed by various governments, SMEs have continued to encounter various obstacles in trade settlement, including difficulties in opening accounts with traditional banks, high risk of fund freezing, high exchange losses, long remittance time, high remittance costs, and even being forced to remit funds through non-compliant channels.\"\\n\\n\"Today, banks, financial institutions, and fintech payment companies have begun to cooperate to find efficient solutions to serve SMEs and enhance financial inclusion. XTransfer has partnered with J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Bank of China, DBS Bank, Visa, and other international banks and financial institutions to provide SMEs engaged in foreign trade with the \"Global Business Account\". The account covers more than 200 countries/regions and more than 15 currencies, offering cross-border payment solutions, foreign exchange, and other financial services,\" Bill added.\\n\\nWhen discussing XTransfer\\'s global expansion, Bill said, \"We have observed that emerging countries, particularly those in the ASEAN region, Africa, and South America, are experiencing a rise in cross-border trade. However, SMEs in these emerging markets often encounter challenges, such as being \"unbanked\" and lacking access to US dollars.\"\\n\\n\"XTransfer is actively expanding into emerging markets such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East; Nigeria and Kenya in Africa; Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines in Southeast Asia; as well as Mexico and Brazil in South America. When both buyer and seller use an XTransfer account, they can utilise the XTransfer-to-XTransfer (X2X) payment service, which allows them to conduct \"Account-to-Account\" payments, enabling seamless transactions between the buyer and seller as if they were making a \"local transfer\". This significantly improves operational capital efficiency for enterprises and promotes global trade.\" Bill added\\n\\nFinally, Bill pointed out, \"In our first six years, we have been focusing on the Mainland China market, assisting SMEs with their foreign trade collection needs. In 2023, we took our first step toward global expansion by entering the Hong Kong market. This year, we participated in the Hong Kong FinTech Week for the first time, and it was incredibly rewarding. We not only broadened our horizons but also showcased our strengths to industry and the public.

It\\'s coming off a 4.7% spurt last week spurred by Donald Trump\\'s presidential victory and a cut to interest rates by the Federal Reserve to bolster the economy.\\n\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 400 points, or 0.9%, as of 10:15 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.1% lower.\\n\\nTesla was the strongest force pushing the S&P 500 higher after rising 6.9%. Its leader, Elon Musk, has become a close ally of Trump\\'s, and its stock jumped nearly 15% the day after the election and has kept rising.\\n\\nSeveral pieces of what\\'s known as the \"Trump trade\" also helped drive the market, as investors try to identify which kinds of companies will be winners under a second Trump term. JPMorgan Chase rose 1.9%, and bank stocks broadly continue to benefit from expectations for stronger economic growth, less regulation from Washington and an increase in mergers and acquisitions.\\n\\nA White House more friendly to big tie-ups has helped Wall Street speculate about a merger between insurers Cigna Group and Humana, for example. It\\'s been so feverish that Cigna said Monday it isn\\'t pursuing a deal with Humana. Cigna\\'s stock rose 6.5%, and Humana\\'s sank 4.9%.\\n\\nStocks of companies more focused on the U.S. economy were also rising more than the rest of the market, including a 1% rally for the smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index, because they\\'re seen as benefiting more from Trump\\'s America First policies than big multinational companies.\\n\\nCompanies are also continuing to deliver earnings reports showing they made more in profit during the summer than analysts expected. Aramark gained 2.2% after it reported broad-based growth during the latest quarter, including for food at stadiums and among customers around the world.\\n\\nThey helped offset a drop of 1.7% for Nvidia, which was the heaviest weight on the market and helped drag the Nasdaq composite in particular.\\n\\nAbbVie tumbled 13.1% after saying trials investigating its treatment for some adults with schizophrenia failed to show statistically significant improvement compared with a placebo group at week six.\\n\\nSome of the sharpest swings were in the crypto market, where bitcoin rose above $82,000 for the first time. Trump has embraced cryptocurrencies generally and pledged to make his country the crypto capital of the world. Bitcoin hit a record of $82,493 in early trading, according to CoinDesk.\\n\\nAnother Trump trade has been a rise in Treasury yields, as traders anticipate potentially higher economic growth, U.S. government debt and inflation because of Trump\\'s policies. But trading in the bond market is closed Monday in observance of Veterans Day.\\n\\nTreasury yields been generally climbing since September, in large part because the U.S. economy has remained much more resilient than feared. The hope is that it can continue to stay solid as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in order to keep the job market humming, now that it\\'s helped get inflation nearly down to its 2% target.\\n\\nBut Trump\\'s win has scrambled expectations for coming cuts to rates. Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many the Fed will deliver next year. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel.\\n\\nStock markets abroad have swung following Trump\\'s election amid worries about increased tariffs and disruptions to global trade.\\n\\nIndexes were mixed Monday, with European markets rising while South Korea\\'s and Hong Kong\\'s sank.\\n\\nAP Writer Zimo Zhong in Hong Kong contributed to this report.', 'source': {'uri': 'register-herald.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Beckley Register-Herald'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'stan_choe@register-herald.com', 'name': 'Stan Choe', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/22/e223a9ae-3c81-50c9-8099-4b724ef80dae/67317e47d185b.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize', 'eventUri': 'eng-10076908', 'sentiment': 0.2313725490196079, 'wgt': 251, 'relevance': 9}, {'uri': '2024-10-525364755', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-10-25', 'time': '00:14:16', 'dateTime': '2024-10-25T00:14:16Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-10-24T19:29:00Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9803921580314636, 'url': 'https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2024-10-24/microsoft-ceo-nadellas-2024-pay-rose-63-to-79-million-on-stock-awards', 'title': \"Microsoft CEO Nadella's 2024 Pay Rose 63% to $79 Million on Stock Awards\", 'body': \"(Reuters) - Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's fiscal 2024 compensation surged 63% to $79.1 million, according to a filing on Thursday, helped by his stock awards in a year when the tech behemoth's market value breached $3 trillion.\\n\\nStock awards for Nadella, who earned $48.5 million in 2023, climbed to about $71 million from $39 million a year earlier.\\n\\nMicrosoft's shares had gained about 31.2% during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\\n\\nBacked by its investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Microsoft is widely seen as a frontrunner in the race for market dominance in the rollout of generative artificial intelligence (AI) among other tech heavyweights.\\n\\nHowever, Nadella's cash incentive of $5.2 million was less than the $10.7 million he was eligible for as he asked for a reduction following multiple cybersecurity breaches reported during the fiscal year, according to the filing.\\n\\nAmong other high-profile tech bosses, Apple's CEO Tim Cook earned $63.2 million in 2023.\\n\\nAI-chip giant Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang's payout was $34.2 million in fiscal 2024.\\n\\n(Reporting by Sourasis Bose in Bengaluru;

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241031095658/en/\\n\\nThrough this partnership, ANEXT Bank will expand its product suite to include a selection of investment funds managed by Schroders, offering MSMEs more opportunities to grow their wealth alongside ANEXT Fixed Deposit, the bank\\'s existing investment product. The first fund from Schroders is expected to be available through ANEXT Bank by 1Q 2025, subject to regulatory approval.\\n\\nOver 30% of ANEXT Bank\\'s customers are Foreign Business Owners (FBOs) from 78 nationalities, operating businesses incorporated in Singapore, while 69% are micro businesses. This expanded offering will allow a diverse global community of MSMEs to manage and grow funds with greater flexibility, while ensuring cash flow liquidity with no lock-in period required.\\n\\nDespite the wide availability of financial products, many small business owners find it challenging to start investing due to high entry barriers and limited financial literacy. According to a recent survey1 conducted by ANEXT Bank, four in five MSMEs have never purchased investment instruments. The top three barriers cited were a lack of excess liquidity, insufficient investment know-how, and limited suitable investment options.\\n\\nMs Eileen Chan, Director at Premium Orchids Singapore echoes the sentiment on investments: \"As a small business owner, investing has never really been on my radar because I always thought it was only for larger companies with substantial capital. With ANEXT Bank\\'s new investment offerings, I\\'m excited about the opportunity to grow my bank balance, even with small amounts. For businesses like mine, every cent counts. This initiative also spares me the hassle of navigating the complexities of different investment options, allowing me to focus on running my business.\"\\n\\nThe partnership between ANEXT Bank and Schroders is designed to make investments more inclusive, catering to the needs of small businesses. By leveraging secure APIs to facilitate seamless integration between ANEXT Bank\\'s online banking platform and Schroders\\' products, the collaboration allows ANEXT Bank customers to conveniently access, manage, and track their investments directly within the platform.\\n\\nANEXT Bank and Schroders will also explore innovation to enhance investment access for MSMEs through asset tokenisation as well as sustainable investment solutions, supporting their sustainability journey. In addition, the two companies will collaborate to promote financial literacy among MSMEs, helping them better understand investments and wealth management, thereby lowering barriers to entry.\\n\\n\"The partnership with Schroders marks a significant milestone for ANEXT Bank as our first collaboration with a global partner. By combining the strengths of both companies, we are bringing greater value to MSMEs by making high-quality investment products more accessible and opening up the world of financial growth to small businesses. Leveraging Schroders\\' leadership and decades of expertise in the investment space, alongside ANEXT Bank\\'s insights into MSMEs and tech-driven innovation, we are excited to take a holistic approach to driving financial inclusion. This includes not only offering innovative products but also providing knowledge and capacity-building to making financial services more inclusive and accessible to micro and growing businesses,\" said Ms Toh Su Mei, CEO of ANEXT Bank.\\n\\n\"MSMEs are the backbone of Singapore\\'s economy, comprising 99% of its enterprises.

BCG\\'s analysis reveals this market growth is driven by a favorable interest rate environment -- due to higher bank revenues from accounts -- and an overall expansion of banking revenue pools.\\n\\nIn parallel, the demand for embedded finance from small-and-medium-sized businesses (SMBs) -- a sector typically underserved by traditional financial institutions -- has broadened well beyond payments. This, coupled with the market\\'s expansion, opens a significant opportunity for SaaS platforms to embed into their offerings more advanced financial products like business accounts, loans, and issued cards. Given typical margins on these products, most platforms have an opportunity to multiply their current revenues by up to three or four times.\\n\\n\"Embedding financial products creates a win-win scenario: SaaS platforms deepen user relationships and unlock new revenue streams by addressing SMBs\\' overlooked financial needs,\" says Blake Breathitt, SVP Platforms & Financial Services at Adyen. \"Our research underscores the window of opportunity for SaaS platforms to embrace embedded finance to stay competitive, or get left behind. There is an immense market opportunity here for SaaS platforms, which are in an ideal position to deliver these within their existing ecosystems.\"\\n\\nThe market is primed with strong demand from SMBs with 50% of SMBs expressing a high likelihood of utilizing a full suite of embedded finance products in the near future, reinforcing its growth potential.\\n\\n\"We are observing an appetite from SMBs to consume a broader range of financial services from within their SaaS platforms, notably loans extending beyond simple cash advances or current accounts tightly integrated in receivables and payables workflows,\" says Stefan Dab, Founder of BCG\\'s Payments and Fintech practice.\\n\\nThe report highlights that top platforms are now generating more than 50% of their revenues from embedded payments and finance, and shines a light on embedded finance as the next critical growth lever for SaaS. To differentiate in an increasingly competitive market, platforms must consider integrating financial products in their offering.\\n\\nAdyen and BCG\\'s report provides a strategic playbook for SaaS platforms looking to succeed in the embedded finance space. It outlines actionable insights on differentiating products from traditional banks, optimizing go-to-market strategies, and forming effective partnerships to drive growth.

The event attracted significant attention to XTransfer\\'s booth, where attendees learned about the company\\'s innovation for secure and speedy global trade payments for SMEs. Bill Deng, Founder and CEO of XTransfer, participated in multiple panel discussions, engaged with leaders from international financial institutions and attended private meetings with various government representatives to explore collaboration opportunities.\\n\\nBill was invited to be the keynote speaker for the \"Next-Gen Digital Payment Infrastructure: Integration, Security & Interoperability\" panel on the first day of the event, which included representatives from Tencent Financial Technology and Payment Asia.\\n\\nDuring his discussion on how AI and other emerging technologies can enhance the efficiency and security of payments, Bill stated, \"XTransfer has built a data-based, automated, Internet-based and intelligent anti-money laundering risk control infrastructure centred on SMEs. By utilising artificial intelligence to assist banks and financial institutions in anti-money laundering and anti-fraud efforts, manual operations are largely reduced, significantly improving efficiency. XTransfer uses technology as a bridge to link large financial institutions and SMEs around the world, allowing them to enjoy the same level of cross-border financial services as large multinational corporations.\"\\n\\nBill was also invited to participate in another panel on \"The Role of Tech in Finance for an Inclusive Future\", where he addressed the topic of promoting financial inclusion. Bill remarked, \"With the increasingly stringent rules and regulations imposed by various governments, SMEs have continued to encounter various obstacles in trade settlement, including difficulties in opening accounts with traditional banks, high risk of fund freezing, high exchange losses, long remittance time, high remittance costs, and even being forced to remit funds through non-compliant channels.\"\\n\\n\"Today, banks, financial institutions, and fintech payment companies have begun to cooperate to find efficient solutions to serve SMEs and enhance financial inclusion. XTransfer has partnered with J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Bank of China, DBS Bank, Visa, and other international banks and financial institutions to provide SMEs engaged in foreign trade with the \"Global Business Account\". The account covers more than 200 countries/regions and more than 15 currencies, offering cross-border payment solutions, foreign exchange, and other financial services,\" Bill added.\\n\\nWhen discussing XTransfer\\'s global expansion, Bill said, \"We have observed that emerging countries, particularly those in the ASEAN region, Africa, and South America, are experiencing a rise in cross-border trade. However, SMEs in these emerging markets often encounter challenges, such as being \"unbanked\" and lacking access to US dollars.\"\\n\\n\"XTransfer is actively expanding into emerging markets such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East; Nigeria and Kenya in Africa; Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines in Southeast Asia; as well as Mexico and Brazil in South America. When both buyer and seller use an XTransfer account, they can utilise the XTransfer-to-XTransfer (X2X) payment service, which allows them to conduct \"Account-to-Account\" payments, enabling seamless transactions between the buyer and seller as if they were making a \"local transfer\". This significantly improves operational capital efficiency for enterprises and promotes global trade.\" Bill added\\n\\nFinally, Bill pointed out, \"In our first six years, we have been focusing on the Mainland China market, assisting SMEs with their foreign trade collection needs. In 2023, we took our first step toward global expansion by entering the Hong Kong market. This year, we participated in the Hong Kong FinTech Week for the first time, and it was incredibly rewarding. We not only broadened our horizons but also showcased our strengths to industry and the public.
