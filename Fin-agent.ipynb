       "  'body': 'By Nikhil Dedha\\n\\nNew Delhi [India], September 21 (ANI): Amid protest by retail trade bodies about deep discounts by big e-commerce players like Amazon and Flipkart, all major e-commerce platforms have announced their biggest sales of the year.\\n\\nThe trade bodies have called deep discounts an unethical practice and asked the government to intervene. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) accused them of undermining the country\\'s retail trade ecosystem.\\n\\n\"These discounts are aimed at attracting consumers, they flagrantly violate rules governing fair trade and pricing. Such excessive discounting not only distorts market competition but also creates an uneven playing field, particularly harming smaller retailers and businesses that cannot compete with these deep discounts,\" said B.C. Bhartia, CAIT National President.\\n\\nMajor players in the e-commerce space are ramping up their marketing campaigns and offering significant price cuts to attract consumers during this crucial shopping period.\\n\\nIn an exclusive conversation with ANI, Saurabh Srivastava, Vice President of Categories at Amazon India, expressed the company\\'s enthusiasm for its highly anticipated sale.\\n\\n\"We are super excited about the upcoming Amazon Great Indian Festival. Last year, it was our biggest festival sale ever, and this year we are expecting it to be the biggest ever again. We have 16 lakh sellers and brand partners who are ready with their best offers. Never seen before prices across electronics, mobile, fashion, health, beauty, and grocery. Across all these, we have never seen before offers that these sellers are going to come up with,\" he said.\\n\\nResponding to the questions of small businesses hurting from the big discounts he stated, \"We have always been about enabling sellers, small and medium businesses, women entrepreneurs, karigars, weavers, bringing all of them together and making ensuring that they can reach and reach customers across the country. We have been focused on digitizing them. We have in fact made a pledge. So for example, one of our pledge was that we want to enable from a base of 16 lac seller, we wanted to enable exports for them\".\\n\\nHowever, while customers look forward to the discounts, these strategies have ignited concerns among small trade bodies, which argue that such aggressive pricing tactics negatively impact traditional small businesses.\\n\\nThe small traders and retailers claim that the steep discounts offered by major e-commerce platforms make it difficult for them to compete, as they often lack the resources to match the offers made by large online retailers.\\n\\nAccording to them, while large e-commerce companies benefit from massive sales, small retailers are struggling to maintain their foothold in the market, especially during the festive season when their businesses would traditionally thrive.

Tech\\'s thirst for power is likely to go unabated because AI and cloud computing are important drivers of growth, although many expect data center efficiency to increase greatly.\\n\\nTech stocks became go-to picks for many such funds, because they made outsized market gains while producing fewer greenhouse gases than stocks in other sectors like manufacturing and energy.\\n\\nInvestments marketed with environmental, social and governance concerns in mind have lost some favour since a pandemic era boom. But there are still some $2.24 trillion in equity in one of the strictest ESG categories: funds that come under Article 8 and 9 funds under the European Union\\'s financial law, according to data firm Morningstar Direct. There was almost $30 trillion in global equity funds held as of last year.\\n\\nA review of the top holdings of the largest such funds shows they are now heavily invested in tech giants, including Apple , Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft , Meta and Nvidia.\\n\\nSome of those investments could be affected if the concerns are not addressed, the investors and analysts said.\\n\\n\"What we will do is make the AI angle a central part of our climate-related engagement with tech companies,\" said Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management.\\n\\nIf the companies were to loosen current commitments to source renewable energy now and in the future, managers may choose to exclude them from some of the more strictly-defined funds.\\n\\nThis would count against them achieving \"sustainable investment\" status, he said.\\n\\nAn Article 8 fund is meant to \"promote...environmental or social characteristics\" while an Article 9 fund \"has sustainable investment as its objective,\" EU rules say.\\n\\nBIG SHIFT\\n\\nPedersen called AI \"one of the biggest potential shifts in the standard composition\" of a sustainable fund.\\n\\n\"Where we have committed a proportion to sustainable investments in our internal ESG scoring, you might see it becoming harder for those companies to fulfil that,\" he said.\\n\\nNordea\\'s 265 billion euros ($291.7 billion) under management includes a total investment of about 17 billion euros in Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, NVIDIA and Meta shares.\\n\\nJason Qi, senior ESG research analyst for Morgan Stanley\\'s Calvert Research and Management, said he had been asking the firms for more information about current energy use. Qi cited Microsoft as a leader in disclosing data like power supply deals (PPAs), but said no company was sharing as much as he wants.\\n\\n\"We are waiting for more details about their AI-related power consumption, the volume of their PPAs, the geographic distribution, the duration,\" Qi said.\\n\\nInvestors are also starting to ask more questions about so-called Scope 3 emissions which emerge from the supply chain.\\n\\nMicrosoft, Amazon and Nvidia declined to comment.

Both said they were treating rising emissions as a challenge.\\n\\nMeta said this year it has been fully offsetting emissions from its operations since 2020 but the resources needed for AI will make it much harder to attain a goal of emitting no more greenhouse gas from its value chain in 2030 than can be offset.\\n\\nIn their most recent environmental reports, Amazon and Apple said their emissions were falling. Calvert\\'s Qi said the power needs would be concentrated at different parts of the supply chain at different stages in AI development, so while data centers need a lot of power now, other companies could bear more of the load in future. AI proponents say the technology could eventually help make other sectors more energy efficient.\\n\\nOne sign the companies are trying to power the boom with low-carbon energy is increasing investment in nuclear.\\n\\nAmazon said this year it was starting to buy nuclear power to supplement renewables.

Tech\\'s thirst for power is likely to go unabated because AI and cloud computing are important drivers of growth, although many expect data center efficiency to increase greatly.\\n\\nTech stocks became go-to picks for many such funds, because they made outsized market gains while producing fewer greenhouse gases than stocks in other sectors like manufacturing and energy.\\n\\nInvestments marketed with environmental, social and governance concerns in mind have lost some favour since a pandemic era boom. But there are still some $2.24 trillion in equity in one of the strictest ESG categories: funds that come under Article 8 and 9 funds under the European Union\\'s financial law, according to data firm Morningstar Direct. There was almost $30 trillion in global equity funds held as of last year.\\n\\nA review of the top holdings of the largest such funds shows they are now heavily invested in tech giants, including Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Nvidia.\\n\\nSome of those investments could be affected if the concerns are not addressed, the investors and analysts said.\\n\\n\"What we will do is make the AI angle a central part of our climate-related engagement with tech companies,\" said Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management.\\n\\nIf the companies were to loosen current commitments to source renewable energy now and in the future, managers may choose to exclude them from some of the more strictly-defined funds.\\n\\nThis would count against them achieving \"sustainable investment\" status, he said.\\n\\nAn Article 8 fund is meant to \"promote...environmental or social characteristics\" while an Article 9 fund \"has sustainable investment as its objective,\" EU rules say.\\n\\nPedersen called AI \"one of the biggest potential shifts in the standard composition\" of a sustainable fund.\\n\\n\"Where we have committed a proportion to sustainable investments in our internal ESG scoring, you might see it becoming harder for those companies to fulfil that,\" he said.\\n\\nNordea\\'s 265 billion euros ($291.7 billion) under management includes a total investment of about 17 billion euros in Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, NVIDIA and Meta shares.\\n\\nJason Qi, senior ESG research analyst for Morgan Stanley\\'s Calvert Research and Management, said he had been asking the firms for more information about current energy use. Qi cited Microsoft as a leader in disclosing data like power supply deals (PPAs), but said no company was sharing as much as he wants.\\n\\n\"We are waiting for more details about their AI-related power consumption, the volume of their PPAs, the geographic distribution, the duration,\" Qi said.\\n\\nInvestors are also starting to ask more questions about so-called Scope 3 emissions which emerge from the supply chain.\\n\\nMicrosoft, Amazon and Nvidia declined to comment. Meta, Alphabet, Apple and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nThe challenge of increased demand for computing power and data centres is not lost on tech companies.\\n\\nMicrosoft, for example, said its supply chain emissions increased 30.9% in 2023, and Alphabet reported a 13% rise in total emissions, citing power and materials needs for data centers. Both said they were treating rising emissions as a challenge.\\n\\nMeta said this year it has been fully offsetting emissions from its operations since 2020 but the resources needed for AI will make it much harder to attain a goal of emitting no more greenhouse gas from its value chain in 2030 than can be offset.\\n\\nIn their most recent environmental reports, Amazon and Apple said their emissions were falling. Calvert\\'s Qi said the power needs would be concentrated at different parts of the supply chain at different stages in AI development, so while data centers need a lot of power now, other companies could bear more of the load in future.

The economic realities of immigration, however, are far more complex than the negative sound bites suggest.\\n\\nFar from being a burden, as critics claim, immigrants play pivotal roles in driving innovation, enhancing productivity and fostering economic growth in their adopted countries. They also elevate their adopted and origin countries\\' standings in global value chains, contributing to economic resilience.\\n\\nWe are economists who study global trade and migration, and our recent work reveals that immigrants contribute far more to the economic fabric of nations than previously understood.\\n\\nBy facilitating what\\'s known as \"trade in value added,\" or TiVA, immigrants play a crucial role in helping countries specialize their production, move up the value chain and significantly enhance trade sophistication.\\n\\nMoving up the value chain means progressing from producing basic, low-value goods to more complex, higher-value products. This shift involves improving skills, technology and production techniques, allowing a country to capture more economic value and develop advanced industries.\\n\\nSo, what exactly is trade in value added, and why is it important?\\n\\nIn today\\'s global economy, products are rarely made entirely in one country. Instead, different stages of production occur across multiple nations. TiVA measures each country\\'s contribution to a final product, providing clearer insight into global value chains. For instance, while an iPhone may be assembled in China, its components come from various countries, each adding value.\\n\\nOur study found that a 10% increase in immigrants from a particular country residing in one of the 38 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member states leads to a 2.08% increase in the value added from their home country that becomes embedded in their host country\\'s exports to the world.\\n\\nThis effect was strongest in the services sector, followed closely by agriculture and manufacturing.\\n\\nTo understand how this works, consider Indian software engineers in Silicon Valley. Their understanding of the U.S. tech industry and India\\'s IT sector can lead to partnerships. These partnerships lead to Indian firms providing specialized coding services for American tech giants. The result? Higher-value U.S. tech exports that incorporate Indian expertise. This perfectly illustrates how immigrants boost trade in value added.\\n\\nOr take Chinese immigrants in Italy\\'s fashion industry. Their cultural knowledge might help Italian luxury brands tailor products for the Chinese market and connect Italian designers with highly skilled textile workers in China. The result? Italian fashion exports incorporate Chinese craftsmanship, elevating both countries\\' global fashion value chain positions.\\n\\nOur findings show that immigrants are pivotal bridges in global trade networks. They leverage their unique knowledge, skills and connections to strengthen economic bonds between nations. That\\'s in line with previous research showing the significant role immigrants play in fostering bilateral trade.\\n\\nIn an era of increasing skepticism toward globalization and migration, understanding the positive economic impacts of immigration is crucial. Our current and previous research, and the findings from related studies, indicate that rather than \"stealing jobs,\" immigrants often create value and new economic opportunities that might not otherwise exist.\\n\\nImmigrants bring diverse skills, knowledge and networks to their host countries that can enhance innovation, fill labor shortages and open new market opportunities. They often possess unique insights into their home country markets, helping host country firms navigate cultural nuances and business practices that might otherwise pose trade barriers.\\n\\nFor home countries, emigrants can serve as cultural ambassadors, creating awareness, showcasing products and services, and helping to integrate their homeland into global value chains. They may also contribute to knowledge transfer, investment flows and business connections that boost their home and host countries\\' economic development.\\n\\nMoreover, immigrants\\' ability to enhance trade in value added suggests they play a role in moving countries up the economic value chain. Rather than simply facilitating trade in raw materials or essential manufactured goods, immigrants appear to boost trade in more sophisticated, higher-value products and services. This is crucial for economic development, as countries that position themselves higher in global value chains tend to see bigger benefits.\\n\\nOur observations have important implications for both immigration and trade. For one, they suggest that restrictive immigration policies might have unintended consequences, hindering a country\\'s trade performance and position in global value chains. Countries that want to become more economically competitive might consider more open immigration policies.\\n\\nWhat\\'s more, our research indicates that immigrants\\' economic benefits extend beyond the often-cited labor-market and fiscal impacts - in other words, having more workers who pay more taxes.\\n\\nThe evidence suggests policymakers should take a more holistic view of immigration\\'s economic effects, considering its role in facilitating sophisticated international trade and value creation.\\n\\nOur results also align with previous research highlighting the potential value of workforce diversity for businesses, particularly for firms engaged in international trade. Employees from diverse national backgrounds can bring valuable insights and connections that help their companies navigate global markets and value chains.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that immigrants\\' impact on trade in value added varies across countries and sectors. This suggests that rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, targeted policies might most effectively leverage immigration for economic benefit.\\n\\nMaximizing immigration\\'s positive impacts on trade and value chains also requires supportive policies and institutions that allow immigrants to use their skills and networks fully. These might include programs to assist with economic integration, language training, credential recognition and support for immigrant entrepreneurship.\\n\\nAs the global economy continues to evolve, with value chains becoming ever more complex and interconnected, the role of immigrants as facilitators of trade and value creation is likely to grow even more significant. Countries that recognize and leverage this potential stand to gain a competitive edge in the global marketplace.\\n\\nOur research paints a picture of immigrants not as economic burdens but as valuable assets who enhance their host and home countries\\' positions in the global economy. By making sophisticated trade linkages possible, and by boosting participation in global value chains, immigrants contribute to economic growth and development in ways that go far beyond conventional understanding.\\n\\nAs debates around immigration continue, it\\'s crucial to move beyond simplistic narratives and recognize the complex and often subtle ways that immigrants contribute to prosperity. In an interconnected world, immigrants aren\\'t just crossing borders - they are helping to weave the fabric of global trade and value creation.\\n\\nThe authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.', 'source': {'uri': 'foreignaffairs.co.nz', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'foreignaffairs.co.nz'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz', 'name': 'Mil-Osi Publisher', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': None, 'eventUri': 'eng-9919940', 'sentiment': 0.2549019607843137, 'wgt': 253, 'relevance': 26}, {'uri': '2024-08-469481716', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-08-29', 'time': '11:35:55', 'dateTime': '2024-08-29T11:35:55Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-08-29T10:07:41Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9921568632125854, 'url': 'https://www.aol.com/exclusive-us-government-funding-yielded-100741103.html', 'title': 'Exclusive-US government funding yielded hundreds of patents for China-based researchers', 'body': 'Exclusive-US government funding yielded hundreds of patents for China-based researchers\\n\\nMichael Martina\\n\\nAugust 29, 2024 at 12:07 PM\\n\\nBy Michael Martina\\n\\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department, NASA and other government agencies funded research that led to more than 1,000 U.S. patents for China-based inventors since 2010, including in sensitive fields such as biotechnology and semiconductors, data from the U.S. patent agency showed.\\n\\nThe U.S. patent data, which was reviewed by Reuters and has not been reported previously, will amplify calls to cancel or renegotiate the landmark U.S.-China Science and Technology Agreement, a cooperation deal that critics say disproportionately benefits Washington\\'s top geopolitical rival.\\n\\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office supplied the data this month to the House of Representatives\\' select committee on China.

There was almost $30 trillion in global equity funds held as of last year.\\n\\nA review of the top holdings of the largest such funds shows they are now heavily invested in tech giants, including Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Nvidia.\\n\\nSome of those investments could be affected if the concerns are not addressed, the investors and analysts said.\\n\\n\"What we will do is make the AI angle a central part of our climate-related engagement with tech companies,\" said Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management.\\n\\nIf the companies were to loosen current commitments to source renewable energy now and in the future, managers may choose to exclude them from some of the more strictly-defined funds.\\n\\nThis would count against them achieving \"sustainable investment\" status, he said.\\n\\nAn Article 8 fund is meant to \"promote...environmental or social characteristics\" while an Article 9 fund \"has sustainable investment as its objective,\" EU rules say.\\n\\nBIG SHIFT\\n\\nPedersen called AI \"one of the biggest potential shifts in the standard composition\" of a sustainable fund.\\n\\n\"Where we have committed a proportion to sustainable investments in our internal ESG scoring, you might see it becoming harder for those companies to fulfil that,\" he said.\\n\\nNordea\\'s 265 billion euros ($291.7 billion) under management includes a total investment of about 17 billion euros in Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, NVIDIA and Meta shares.\\n\\nJason Qi, senior ESG research analyst for Morgan Stanley\\'s Calvert Research and Management, said he had been asking the firms for more information about current energy use.

Both said they were treating rising emissions as a challenge.\\n\\nMeta said this year it has been fully offsetting emissions from its operations since 2020 but the resources needed for AI will make it much harder to attain a goal of emitting no more greenhouse gas from its value chain in 2030 than can be offset.\\n\\nIn their most recent environmental reports, Amazon and Apple said their emissions were falling. Calvert\\'s Qi said the power needs would be concentrated at different parts of the supply chain at different stages in AI development, so while data centers need a lot of power now, other companies could bear more of the load in future.

It was originally published at The Conversation.\\n\\nIn nearly every country that hosts foreign-born citizens, immigration emerges as a lightning rod for controversy. The economic realities of immigration, however, are far more complex than the negative sound bites suggest.\\n\\nFar from being a burden, as critics claim, immigrants play pivotal roles in driving innovation, enhancing productivity and fostering economic growth in their adopted countries. They also elevate their adopted and origin countries\\' standings in global value chains, contributing to economic resilience.\\n\\nWe are economists who study global trade and migration, and our recent work reveals that immigrants contribute far more to the economic fabric of nations than previously understood.\\n\\nBy facilitating what\\'s known as \"trade in value added,\" or TiVA, immigrants play a crucial role in helping countries specialize their production, move up the value chain and significantly enhance trade sophistication.\\n\\nMoving up the value chain means progressing from producing basic, low-value goods to more complex, higher-value products. This shift involves improving skills, technology and production techniques, allowing a country to capture more economic value and develop advanced industries.\\n\\nSo, what exactly is trade in value added, and why is it important?\\n\\nIn today\\'s global economy, products are rarely made entirely in one country. Instead, different stages of production occur across multiple nations. TiVA measures each country\\'s contribution to a final product, providing clearer insight into global value chains. For instance, while an iPhone may be assembled in China, its components come from various countries, each adding value.\\n\\nOur study found that a 10% increase in immigrants from a particular country residing in one of the 38 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member states leads to a 2.08% increase in the value added from their home country that becomes embedded in their host country\\'s exports to the world.\\n\\nThis effect was strongest in the services sector, followed closely by agriculture and manufacturing.\\n\\nTo understand how this works, consider Indian software engineers in Silicon Valley. Their understanding of the U.S. tech industry and India\\'s IT sector can lead to partnerships. These partnerships lead to Indian firms providing specialized coding services for American tech giants. The result? Higher-value U.S. tech exports that incorporate Indian expertise. This perfectly illustrates how immigrants boost trade in value added.\\n\\nOr take Chinese immigrants in Italy\\'s fashion industry. Their cultural knowledge might help Italian luxury brands tailor products for the Chinese market and connect Italian designers with highly skilled textile workers in China. The result? Italian fashion exports incorporate Chinese craftsmanship, elevating both countries\\' global fashion value chain positions.\\n\\nOur findings show that immigrants are pivotal bridges in global trade networks. They leverage their unique knowledge, skills and connections to strengthen economic bonds between nations. That\\'s in line with previous research showing the significant role immigrants play in fostering bilateral trade.\\n\\nIn an era of increasing skepticism toward globalization and migration, understanding the positive economic impacts of immigration is crucial. Our current and previous research, and the findings from related studies, indicate that rather than \"stealing jobs,\" immigrants often create value and new economic opportunities that might not otherwise exist.\\n\\nImmigrants bring diverse skills, knowledge and networks to their host countries that can enhance innovation, fill labor shortages and open new market opportunities. They often possess unique insights into their home country markets, helping host country firms navigate cultural nuances and business practices that might otherwise pose trade barriers.\\n\\nFor home countries, emigrants can serve as cultural ambassadors, creating awareness, showcasing products and services, and helping to integrate their homeland into global value chains. They may also contribute to knowledge transfer, investment flows and business connections that boost their home and host countries\\' economic development.\\n\\nMoreover, immigrants\\' ability to enhance trade in value added suggests they play a role in moving countries up the economic value chain. Rather than simply facilitating trade in raw materials or essential manufactured goods, immigrants appear to boost trade in more sophisticated, higher-value products and services. This is crucial for economic development, as countries that position themselves higher in global value chains tend to see bigger benefits.\\n\\nOur observations have important implications for both immigration and trade. For one, they suggest that restrictive immigration policies might have unintended consequences, hindering a country\\'s trade performance and position in global value chains. Countries that want to become more economically competitive might consider more open immigration policies.\\n\\nWhat\\'s more, our research indicates that immigrants\\' economic benefits extend beyond the often-cited labor-market and fiscal impacts -- in other words, having more workers who pay more taxes.\\n\\nThe evidence suggests policymakers should take a more holistic view of immigration\\'s economic effects, considering its role in facilitating sophisticated international trade and value creation.\\n\\nOur results also align with previous research highlighting the potential value of workforce diversity for businesses, particularly for firms engaged in international trade. Employees from diverse national backgrounds can bring valuable insights and connections that help their companies navigate global markets and value chains.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that immigrants\\' impact on trade in value added varies across countries and sectors. This suggests that rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, targeted policies might most effectively leverage immigration for economic benefit.\\n\\nMaximizing immigration\\'s positive impacts on trade and value chains also requires supportive policies and institutions that allow immigrants to use their skills and networks fully. These might include programs to assist with economic integration, language training, credential recognition and support for immigrant entrepreneurship.\\n\\nAs the global economy continues to evolve, with value chains becoming ever more complex and interconnected, the role of immigrants as facilitators of trade and value creation is likely to grow even more significant. Countries that recognize and leverage this potential stand to gain a competitive edge in the global marketplace.\\n\\nOur research paints a picture of immigrants not as economic burdens but as valuable assets who enhance their host and home countries\\' positions in the global economy. By making sophisticated trade linkages possible, and by boosting participation in global value chains, immigrants contribute to economic growth and development in ways that go far beyond conventional understanding.\\n\\nAs debates around immigration continue, it\\'s crucial to move beyond simplistic narratives and recognize the complex and often subtle ways that immigrants contribute to prosperity. In an interconnected world, immigrants aren\\'t just crossing borders -- they are helping to weave the fabric of global trade and value creation.', 'source': {'uri': 'talkingpointsmemo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Talking Points Memo'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2147900762.jpg?w=804', 'eventUri': 'eng-9919940', 'sentiment': 0.2, 'wgt': 253, 'relevance': 26}, {'uri': '8311777018', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-09-08', 'time': '07:59:52', 'dateTime': '2024-09-08T07:59:52Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-09-08T07:59:05Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9921568632125854, 'url': 'https://taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/5932590', 'title': \"Sahm Capital Chairman Highlights Technology's Role in Driving Growth and Innovation at 24 Fintech in Riyadh | Taiwan News | Sep. 8, 2024 15:45\", 'body': 'RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA - Media OutReach Newswire - 8 September 2024 - Steven Chou, Chairman of Sahm Capital and Chief Strategy Officer of Valuable Capital Group Limited, highlighted the transformative role of technology in Saudi Arabia\\'s financial sector during his speech at the 24 Fintech in Riyadh.

But four weeks on from the worst volatility blowup since the pandemic, August will go down as another grand gesture of confidence by Wall Street in its ability to suss out the future.\\n\\nLevels of conviction are soaring across assets. In one example, exchange-traded funds tracking government debt, corporate credit and equities have now risen in unison for four straight months. It\\'s the longest stretch of correlated gains since at least 2007. Up 25% in the past 12 months, the S&P 500 has never climbed this much in the run-up to the first interest-rate cut of an easing cycle, seven decades of data compiled by Ned Davis Research and Bloomberg show.\\n\\nTraders are leaning into bets with zeal even as serious questions linger about the economy and inflation -- and how central bankers will respond. Before the Federal Reserve has even begun to act, bond markets have priced in a slew of rate cuts, measures of default risk are falling and surging equities reflect sure-thing bets the economy will boom.\\n\\nGains of 2.3% for the S&P 500 in August, 1.8% for an ETF tracking long-dated Treasuries and 1.5% for investment-grade bonds all amount to a big show of force by cross-asset bulls, who are convinced Fed Chair Jerome Powell will cut rates into a healthy economy. All told, the wagers are at the mercy of how economic data -- capricious of late -- plays out on the cusp of the central bank\\'s meeting on Sept. 18.\\n\\n\"Everything has to go right,\" said Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"We need to continue to have trend or above trend economic growth. We need to have a labor market that\\'s not too hot, not too cold. And that then would allow for the consumer to continue to consume. Those things all have to be in a perfect balance.\"\\n\\nWhile markets have righted themselves, the travails of early August demonstrate the delicacy of the present consensus, with a single government report -- US hiring data for July -- fueling convulsions that briefly sent Wall Street\\'s fear gauge, the VIX, above 65. August\\'s employment update is just seven days away -- with economist forecasts compiled by Bloomberg putting payroll additions anywhere from 100,000 to 208,000.\\n\\nData on US manufacturing, durable-goods orders and initial jobless claims are also due next week, each with the potential to influence sentiment at a time when growth has become a singular obsession of markets. At Jackson Hole, Wyoming, last week, Powell said \"the direction of travel is clear\" on future policy, but that \"the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks.\"\\n\\nFed dovishness was instrumental in pulling Wall Street\\'s investment complex through its summer tantrum, with the flash crash in early August quickly consigned to history. All four major asset ETFs (tickers: SPY, TLT, LQD, HYG) rose at least 1% for the month while more than $1 trillion was added to American equities alone.\\n\\nTraders are pouncing on everything from small-cap stocks to speculative debt convinced that the world\\'s largest economy will avoid a consumer-led downturn despite a weakening labor market. Funds focused on US stocks added $5.8 billion for a ninth straight week of inflows and those specialized in high yield attracted $1.7 billion, EPFR Global data compiled by Bank of America Corp. show.\\n\\nFor now at least, nothing in economic data or corporate earnings is screaming danger. Yet if there is a lesson in August\\'s rout, it\\'s that consensus bets -- going long artificial intelligence, exploiting the weakening yen -- can backfire suddenly.\\n\\nFor a sense of the tenuousness, consider the path of rate cuts priced in Fed fund futures. Back in January, when inflation fears ebbed, bond traders wagered on roughly six rate reductions for all of 2024, with the first one arriving as early as March. When inflation proved stickier than forecast, those bets were pared and by April, only one cut was expected.\\n\\nNow the consensus is, the Fed will kick off its easing cycle next month, with four quarter-point reductions by December.\\n\\n\"The reality is both the Fed\\'s own guess in the dot plot and the market\\'s expectations are always wrong,\" said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management. \"I could see easily three cuts this year. Four might sound pretty extreme. It would probably only happen if the economy was really in bad shape.\"\\n\\nAt the same time, caution has mostly proved a costly investment philosophy this year. In the credit market, the much dreaded maturity wall -- the threat of painful refinancings by corporate borrowers at higher rates -- is collapsing as the amount of looming debt repayments in the junk bond market is poised for the biggest annual decline in at least a decade. Credit default swaps, or instruments designed to hedge exposure to credit risks, have retreated as the Markit CDX North American High Yield Index hovered near the lowest levels since early 2022.\\n\\nRather than taking a hit from higher borrowing costs as many had feared, corporate earnings may in fact have benefited from the jump in benchmark rates from 0% to over 5%. That allowed cash-rich firms, technology megacaps in particular, to enjoy a steady stream of income from their bond investments.\\n\\nAccording to Kaixian Tan, an analyst at Gavekal Research, the entire increase in non-financial corporate income since 2022 can be attributed to a drop in interest payments on a net basis -- a counterintuitive situation where booming interest income broadly offset rising debt service costs as rates rose. Now with interest rates heading lower, that tailwind is under threat.\\n\\n\"Rate cuts will squeeze corporates\\' interest income, and therefore their profits,\" Tan wrote in a note this week. \"This will disproportionately hit big companies sitting on large cash mountains, and may lead to their relative underperformance.\"\\n\\nTo Jack McIntyre, global bond portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management, predicting anything in the post-pandemic world is nearly futile. If he had to venture a guess, it\\'s that economic resilience will dull in the coming year and in that environment, bonds will beat stocks.\\n\\n\"To me, a soft landing is just a hard landing postponed,\" he said. \"I don\\'t think we go from soft landing back to a no landing.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'economictimes.indiatimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Economic Times'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112939943,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-375650,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-9864779', 'sentiment': 0.02745098039215677, 'wgt': 253, 'relevance': 26}, {'uri': '8328011684', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-09-19', 'time': '11:22:25', 'dateTime': '2024-09-19T11:22:25Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-09-19T11:21:55Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9921568632125854, 'url': 'https://santamariatimes.com/ap/national/critical-defect-rate-rises-to-1-58-per-aces-mortgage-qc-industry-trends-report/article_7c3c1914-b761-528a-b7cd-c9eb4e0bce6e.html', 'title': 'Critical Defect Rate Rises to 1.58%, Per ACES Mortgage QC Industry Trends Report', 'body': '- This modest defect rate increase ends a five-quarter downward trend -\\n\\nDENVER, Colo., Sept. 19, 2024 (SEND2PRESS NEWSWIRE) -- ACES Quality Management® (ACES), the leading provider of enterprise quality management and control software for the financial services industry, announced the release of its quarterly ACES Mortgage QC Industry Trends Report covering the first quarter (Q1) of 2024. The latest report analyzes post-closing quality control data derived from ACES Quality Management & Control® software.\\n\\nNotable findings from the Q1 2024 report include the following:\\n\\nThe overall critical defect rate increased 3.27% to 1.58% in Q1 2024, ending five quarters of decline.While Income/Employment remains the leading category of defects, performance improved tremendously quarter-over-quarter in this category.Defects increased in two of the four major underwriting categories, with Credit defects nearly doubling from Q4 2023.Legal/Regulatory/Compliance defects increased by 208.37% to 16.22%, becoming the second-highest category of defects this quarter, followed by Loan Documentation at 14.41%.Insurance defects, while usually negligible, comprised 8.11% of all defects.Although refinance review share declined this quarter, defect share doubled, indicating a degradation in quality in this area.Defect share outstripped review share for conventional loans this quarter, most certainly fueled by the surge in refinance defects.Both review share and defect share declined in the FHA category. Lenders also saw substantial improvements in VA defect share despite significantly increasing review share over Q4.\\n\\n\"Given origination levels in the first quarter of this year, the findings in this report showed greater changes than expected,\" said ACES Executive Vice President Nick Volpe. \"Historically, defect rates decrease when there is a decline in origination levels; however, that was not the case for Q1. Mortgage lenders are no strangers to market adversity. While the market is shifting, we hope this report will serve as a reminder to reinforce quality control across the board.\"\\n\\nFindings for the Q1 ACES Mortgage QC Industry Trends Report are based on post-closing quality control data derived from the ACES Quality Management and Control® benchmarking system and incorporate data from prior quarters and/or calendar years, where applicable. All reviews and defect data evaluated for the report were based on loan audits selected by lenders for full file reviews.\\n\\n\"The current mortgage market presents distinct challenges that lenders must navigate with precision. Although the critical defect rate remains low by historical standards, the increase in a quarter with record-low origination volumes is concerning. Notable rises across underwriting categories and unexpected insurance defects need closer scrutiny from lenders,\" said Trevor Gauthier, CEO of ACES Quality Management. \"Overall, the data clearly shows that lenders are under increasing pressure to maintain quality amid changing market dynamics. A proactive approach to quality control is crucial for mitigating risk and ensuring long-term stability.\"\\n\\nThe Mortgage QC Industry Trends Reports are available for download, free of charge, at https://www.acesquality.com/resources/reports.\\n\\nAbout ACES Quality Management:\\n\\nACES Quality Management is the leading provider of enterprise quality management and control software for the financial services industry.

Tech\\'s thirst for power is likely to go unabated because AI and cloud computing are important drivers of growth, although many expect data center efficiency to increase greatly.\\n\\nTech stocks became go-to picks for many such funds, because they made outsized market gains while producing fewer greenhouse gases than stocks in other sectors like manufacturing and energy.\\n\\nInvestments marketed with environmental, social and governance concerns in mind have lost some favour since a pandemic era boom. But there are still some $2.24 trillion in equity in one of the strictest ESG categories: funds that come under Article 8 and 9 funds under the European Union\\'s financial law, according to data firm Morningstar Direct.

Qi cited Microsoft as a leader in disclosing data like power supply deals (PPAs), but said no company was sharing as much as he wants.\\n\\n\"We are waiting for more details about their AI-related power consumption, the volume of their PPAs, the geographic distribution, the duration,\" Qi said.\\n\\nInvestors are also starting to ask more questions about so-called Scope 3 emissions which emerge from the supply chain.\\n\\nMicrosoft, Amazon and Nvidia declined to comment. Meta, Alphabet, Apple and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nA CHALLENGE\\n\\nThe challenge of increased demand for computing power and data centres is not lost on tech companies.\\n\\nMicrosoft, for example, said its supply chain emissions increased 30.9% in 2023, and Alphabet reported a 13% rise in total emissions, citing power and materials needs for data centers. Both said they were treating rising emissions as a challenge.\\n\\nMeta said this year it has been fully offsetting emissions from its operations since 2020 but the resources needed for AI will make it much harder to attain a goal of emitting no more greenhouse gas from its value chain in 2030 than can be offset.\\n\\nIn their most recent environmental reports, Amazon and Apple said their emissions were falling. Calvert\\'s Qi said the power needs would be concentrated at different parts of the supply chain at different stages in AI development, so while data centers need a lot of power now, other companies could bear more of the load in future. AI proponents say the technology could eventually help make other sectors more energy efficient.\\n\\nOne sign the companies are trying to power the boom with low-carbon energy is increasing investment in nuclear.\\n\\nAmazon said this year it was starting to buy nuclear power to supplement renewables. And Microsoft said last week it had signed a deal to help resurrect a mothballed nuclear plant in Pennsylvania in the first restart of its kind in history.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Swedish bank Handelsbanken, which offers two Article 9 funds that track indexes with Google and Microsoft among their top five holdings, said improving sustainability data is making it easier to identify where portfolios need adjusting.\\n\\nThe Article 9 funds are built with the aim of showing a 7% average reduction in carbon emissions from all the constituent stocks combined every year, \"which means that over time companies that increase their carbon emissions will likely receive a lower weight in the fund,\" said Aurora Samuelsson, head of sustainability at Handelsbanken Asset Management.\\n\\n\"We raise and will raise the relevant and material issues in our dialogue with the companies,\" Samuelsson said.\\n\\n(Reporting by Isla Binnie; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Anna Driver)', 'source': {'uri': 'usnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'U.S. News & World Report'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/74643e6/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fe0%2F354d86967fe6510f4b973a20e5ef3c%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK8P0CG%3A12024-09-26T100406Z_1_LYNXMPEK8P0CG_RTROPTP_3_CLIMATE-TECH-INVESTING.JPG', 'eventUri': 'eng-9942552', 'sentiment': 0.411764705882353, 'wgt': 253, 'relevance': 60}, {'uri': '8337944028', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-09-26', 'time': '10:31:01', 'dateTime': '2024-09-26T10:31:01Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-09-26T10:30:16Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9921568632125854, 'url': 'https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-power-thirst-complicates-esg-investors-love-affair-with-tech-stocks/', 'title': \"Power thirst complicates ESG investors' love affair with tech stocks\", 'body': 'Investors who manage hundreds of billions of dollars are pressing Microsoft, Alphabet and others for more information on the power needed for artificial intelligence and advanced computing, to help decide whether the sector should stay heavily represented in sustainable funds, investors said.\\n\\nWhile these conversations are at an early stage, six fund industry executives in Europe and the United States said they are looking more closely at the environmental impact of the AI boom, which Goldman Sachs estimates will boost data center power demand 160% by 2030.\\n\\nNone of the investors contacted by Reuters said they were considering divesting.\\n\\nSome of the biggest tech companies leading the AI race that requires building and powering data centers have started reporting increased greenhouse gas emissions, raising questions from asset managers who want to show their portfolios do well not only financially but also by the environment.

The benchmark S&P 500 index, Nasdaq and Dow are on track for their biggest daily declines since early August.\\n\\nShares of chip stocks were hard hit, with AI heavyweight Nvidia tumbling nearly 10% and Wall Street\\'s chip index the PHLX chip index slumping 8%.\\n\\nTODD SOHN, ETF STRATEGIST, STRATEGAS LLC, NEW YORK:\\n\\n\"Such a massive amount of money has gone to tech and semiconductors in the last 12 months that the trade is completely skewed. Since the Fed paused rate increases a year ago, more than $30 billion has flowed into U.S. technology-related ETFs; meanwhile all other sector ETFs lost $10 billion in the same time period. Tactical allocations go into those sector ETFs, and imbalances like this can persist for a while, but eventually, the steam runs out of the trade.\\n\\n\"Then there are the earnings - it\\'s also hard to keep beating those high expectations. Plus, now we have Broadcom\\'s results due Thursday. And if you put ten people in a room and asked them why this is happening, at least one would point to the election and the possibility that a new administration would do something to tariffs that would affect chips.\\n\\n\"Finally, while it wouldn\\'t be at the top of my list, there\\'s the calendar. People may have woken up this morning and realized it\\'s September, which historically is not a great month for stocks. Add to that the fact that so far this year the largest drawdown we\\'ve seen in the S&P 500 is about 8%, and that typically we\\'d see something around 14%, people are nervous.\"\\n\\nSTEVE SOSNICK, MARKET STRATEGIST, INTERACTIVE BROKERS, GREENWICH, CT.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a bit of a post-Nvidia earnings hangover going on today. Those earnings last week were fine; they exceeded expectations. But the magnitude of the beats is shrinking quarter by quarter and that\\'s not lost on investors. The stock had rallied going into earnings - a huge amount of investment poured into it - and so it wasn\\'t just sufficient to be good, it had to be great. And Friday\\'s rally took place in remarkably light volume ahead of a long weekend that happened to coincide with the end of the month, so the typical markup that happens at the end of a calendar month met no resistance.\\n\\n\"This week is different, and so you\\'ve seen a nasty day. There\\'s concern about what the job numbers are going to show, about seasonality. That\\'s why the VIX is higher. I don\\'t think the ISM number, showing a weaker manufacturing sector but higher prices, was at all helpful. And there you have it. Gravity.\"\\n\\nDENNIS DICK, TRADER AT TRIPLE D TRADING:\\n\\n\"If you look at the action on Friday, everything was rallying, but Nvidia was lagging. So, you could see the relative strength was poor after their earnings print. It hasn\\'t been good since then.\"\\n\\n\"September is seasonally a very weak month of the year, so I think people are nervous. People are just using this as an excuse to take profits and the most likely candidates to take profits are the semis, because they\\'ve been the strongest.\"\\n\\nSTEPHEN MASSOCCA, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, WEDBUSH SECURITIES, SAN FRANCISCO:\\n\\n\"We ran right back up to the new high again. There was absolutely zero news over the weekend that meant anything to anybody. But here we are down 600 points.\"\\n\\n\"They\\'re expensive. They\\'re not cheap stocks. I mean, wow, I don\\'t know what Nvidia needed to do in the quarter... It was a pretty freaking good quarter, a couple minor issues, but it just goes to show you these things are just very expensive.\\n\\n\"It also becomes a little bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy because so much money now flows into ETFs and so much money flows into S&P and target funds and all that. It just gets spread across the market and it gets spread across the market on a market cap weighted basis, so it sort of becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you\\'re one of the top market cap names in the S&P 500 and all the money is pouring into S&P 500 ETFs funds, how does that not help you? And I think that\\'s part of it, and that\\'s part of why you get these stretched valuations.\"\\n\\nBRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ANNEX WEALTH MANAGEMENT, BROOKFIELD, WI\\n\\n\"People are worrying and thinking about all kinds of macro issues. Has the Fed fumbled the ball? The fear is that it is tripping over its own feet when it comes to the timing and pace of rate cuts instead of sticking the landing. Will the jobs report increase the odds of a recession? The biggest thing here is the possibility that investors will sell what has gone up the most in the face of any softening.\"\\n\\nSCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST AT WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE\\n\\n\"We came in with the futures down but once this ISM number came out it triggered this fall.\"\\n\\n\"The market is worried about how drastic the slowdown is going to be. The tech sector, even with this pullback we\\'ve had today, it\\'s still up a lot for the year and these things have moved a lot. These stocks led the chart up and on down days they will lead the chart down. When you look at something like 2/10 inversions the last 8 recessions curve has gone positive before recession occurs and we\\'re only a few basis points away. The market is thinking about that too.\"\\n\\nMICHAEL GREEN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SIMPLIFY, SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA\\n\\n\"People are over allocated to Nvidia and many of these names and they\\'re trying to reduce that exposure. It just has the potential for these things to sell off quite significantly\"\\n\\n\"I also think there is a derisking related to election as the election season officially starts now when people are back from Labor Day and everybody is off the beach. Everybody looked at their portfolios and said that going into the political uncertainty of a tight election, we want to have less risk. The PMI report was an excuse for that.\"\\n\\nCALLIE COX, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, RITHOLTZ WEALTH MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK\\n\\n\"Stocks are starting the fall off on a sour note, yet it\\'s hard to say exactly why people are selling today. Tech is dragging the index down, with Nvidia accounting for about a third of the S&P 500\\'s losses. We saw a manufacturing report come out this morning that suggests goods demand is slowing. But it wasn\\'t shockingly bad data, and the narrative of slowing demand isn\\'t exactly surprising.\\n\\n\"I\\'d pin some of the drop on seasonality. September is typically a rough month of the year for the stock market - and the S&P 500 has fallen on the Tuesday after Labor Day every year since 2016. People may simply just be catching up to what they missed during the dog days of summer.\\n\\n\"Believe in this bull market, but shield yourself against rash decisions in what could be a turbulent fall. And don\\'t get distracted by short-term market swings. Since 1950, 60% of market selloffs haven\\'t reached correction territory, and 26% have ended before the dreaded bear market level.\"\\n\\n(Reporting by Suzanne McGee, Noel Randewich, Chuck Mikolajczak, Chibuike Oguh, David Randall, Laura Matthews and Carolina Mandl; Compiled by Megan Davies)', 'source': {'uri': 'ca.finance.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo!

But four weeks on from the worst volatility blowup since the pandemic, August will go down as another grand gesture of confidence by Wall Street in its ability to suss out the future.\\n\\nLevels of conviction are soaring across assets. In one example, exchange-traded funds tracking government debt, corporate credit and equities have now risen in unison for four straight months. It\\'s the longest stretch of correlated gains since at least 2007. Up 25% in the past 12 months, the S&P 500 has never climbed this much in the run-up to the first interest-rate cut of an easing cycle, seven decades of data compiled by Ned Davis Research and Bloomberg show.\\n\\nTraders are leaning into bets with zeal even as serious questions linger about the economy and inflation -- and how central bankers will respond. Before the Federal Reserve has even begun to act, bond markets have priced in a slew of rate cuts, measures of default risk are falling and surging equities reflect sure-thing bets the economy will boom.\\n\\nGains of 2.3% for the S&P 500 in August, 1.8% for an ETF tracking long-dated Treasuries and 1.5% for investment-grade bonds all amount to a big show of force by cross-asset bulls, who are convinced Fed Chair Jerome Powell will cut rates into a healthy economy. All told, the wagers are at the mercy of how economic data -- capricious of late -- plays out on the cusp of the central bank\\'s meeting on Sept. 18.\\n\\n\"Everything has to go right,\" said Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"We need to continue to have trend or above trend economic growth. We need to have a labor market that\\'s not too hot, not too cold. And that then would allow for the consumer to continue to consume. Those things all have to be in a perfect balance.\"\\n\\nWhile markets have righted themselves, the travails of early August demonstrate the delicacy of the present consensus, with a single government report -- US hiring data for July -- fueling convulsions that briefly sent Wall Street\\'s fear gauge, the VIX, above 65. August\\'s employment update is just seven days away -- with economist forecasts compiled by Bloomberg putting payroll additions anywhere from 100,000 to 208,000.\\n\\nData on US manufacturing, durable-goods orders and initial jobless claims are also due next week, each with the potential to influence sentiment at a time when growth has become a singular obsession of markets. At Jackson Hole, Wyoming, last week, Powell said \"the direction of travel is clear\" on future policy, but that \"the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks.\"\\n\\nFed dovishness was instrumental in pulling Wall Street\\'s investment complex through its summer tantrum, with the flash crash in early August quickly consigned to history. All four major asset ETFs (tickers: SPY, TLT, LQD, HYG) rose at least 1% for the month while more than $1 trillion was added to American equities alone.\\n\\nTraders are pouncing on everything from small-cap stocks to speculative debt convinced that the world\\'s largest economy will avoid a consumer-led downturn despite a weakening labor market. Funds focused on US stocks added $5.8 billion for a ninth straight week of inflows and those specialized in high yield attracted $1.7 billion, EPFR Global data compiled by Bank of America Corp. show.\\n\\nFor now at least, nothing in economic data or corporate earnings is screaming danger. Yet if there is a lesson in August\\'s rout, it\\'s that consensus bets -- going long artificial intelligence, exploiting the weakening yen -- can backfire suddenly.\\n\\nFor a sense of the tenuousness, consider the path of rate cuts priced in Fed fund futures. Back in January, when inflation fears ebbed, bond traders wagered on roughly six rate reductions for all of 2024, with the first one arriving as early as March. When inflation proved stickier than forecast, those bets were pared and by April, only one cut was expected.\\n\\nNow the consensus is, the Fed will kick off its easing cycle next month, with four quarter-point reductions by December.\\n\\n\"The reality is both the Fed\\'s own guess in the dot plot and the market\\'s expectations are always wrong,\" said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management. \"I could see easily three cuts this year. Four might sound pretty extreme. It would probably only happen if the economy was really in bad shape.\"\\n\\nAt the same time, caution has mostly proved a costly investment philosophy this year. In the credit market, the much dreaded maturity wall -- the threat of painful refinancings by corporate borrowers at higher rates -- is collapsing as the amount of looming debt repayments in the junk bond market is poised for the biggest annual decline in at least a decade. Credit default swaps, or instruments designed to hedge exposure to credit risks, have retreated as the Markit CDX North American High Yield Index hovered near the lowest levels since early 2022.\\n\\nRather than taking a hit from higher borrowing costs as many had feared, corporate earnings may in fact have benefited from the jump in benchmark rates from 0% to over 5%. That allowed cash-rich firms, technology megacaps in particular, to enjoy a steady stream of income from their bond investments.\\n\\nAccording to Kaixian Tan, an analyst at Gavekal Research, the entire increase in non-financial corporate income since 2022 can be attributed to a drop in interest payments on a net basis -- a counterintuitive situation where booming interest income broadly offset rising debt service costs as rates rose. Now with interest rates heading lower, that tailwind is under threat.\\n\\n\"Rate cuts will squeeze corporates\\' interest income, and therefore their profits,\" Tan wrote in a note this week. \"This will disproportionately hit big companies sitting on large cash mountains, and may lead to their relative underperformance.\"\\n\\nTo Jack McIntyre, global bond portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management, predicting anything in the post-pandemic world is nearly futile. If he had to venture a guess, it\\'s that economic resilience will dull in the coming year and in that environment, bonds will beat stocks.\\n\\n\"To me, a soft landing is just a hard landing postponed,\" he said. \"I don\\'t think we go from soft landing back to a no landing.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'economictimes.indiatimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Economic Times'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112939943,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-375650,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-9864779', 'sentiment': 0.02745098039215677, 'wgt': 253, 'relevance': 26}, {'uri': '2024-09-496969714', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-09-26', 'time': '10:31:12', 'dateTime': '2024-09-26T10:31:12Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-09-26T06:04:00Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9921568632125854, 'url': 'https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-09-26/analysis-power-thirst-complicates-esg-investors-love-affair-with-tech-stocks', 'title': \"Analysis-Power Thirst Complicates ESG Investors' Love Affair With Tech Stocks\", 'body': 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors who manage hundreds of billions of dollars are pressing Microsoft, Alphabet and others for more information on the power needed for artificial intelligence and advanced computing, to help decide whether the sector should stay heavily represented in sustainable funds, investors said.\\n\\nWhile these conversations are at an early stage, six fund industry executives in Europe and the United States said they are looking more closely at the environmental impact of the AI boom, which Goldman Sachs estimates will boost data center power demand 160% by 2030.\\n\\nNone of the investors contacted by Reuters said they were considering divesting.\\n\\nSome of the biggest tech companies leading the AI race that requires building and powering data centers have started reporting increased greenhouse gas emissions, raising questions from asset managers who want to show their portfolios do well not only financially but also by the environment. Tech\\'s thirst for power is likely to go unabated because AI and cloud computing are important drivers of growth, although many expect data center efficiency to increase greatly.\\n\\nTech stocks became go-to picks for many such funds, because they made outsized market gains while producing fewer greenhouse gases than stocks in other sectors like manufacturing and energy.\\n\\nInvestments marketed with environmental, social and governance concerns in mind have lost some favour since a pandemic era boom. But there are still some $2.24 trillion in equity in one of the strictest ESG categories: funds that come under Article 8 and 9 funds under the European Union\\'s financial law, according to data firm Morningstar Direct. There was almost $30 trillion in global equity funds held as of last year.\\n\\nA review of the top holdings of the largest such funds shows they are now heavily invested in tech giants, including Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Nvidia.\\n\\nSome of those investments could be affected if the concerns are not addressed, the investors and analysts said.\\n\\n\"What we will do is make the AI angle a central part of our climate-related engagement with tech companies,\" said Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management.\\n\\nIf the companies were to loosen current commitments to source renewable energy now and in the future, managers may choose to exclude them from some of the more strictly-defined funds.\\n\\nThis would count against them achieving \"sustainable investment\" status, he said.\\n\\nAn Article 8 fund is meant to \"promote...environmental or social characteristics\" while an Article 9 fund \"has sustainable investment as its objective,\" EU rules say.\\n\\nBIG SHIFT\\n\\nPedersen called AI \"one of the biggest potential shifts in the standard composition\" of a sustainable fund.\\n\\n\"Where we have committed a proportion to sustainable investments in our internal ESG scoring, you might see it becoming harder for those companies to fulfil that,\" he said.\\n\\nNordea\\'s 265 billion euros ($291.7 billion) under management includes a total investment of about 17 billion euros in Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, NVIDIA and Meta shares.\\n\\nJason Qi, senior ESG research analyst for Morgan Stanley\\'s Calvert Research and Management, said he had been asking the firms for more information about current energy use. Qi cited Microsoft as a leader in disclosing data like power supply deals (PPAs), but said no company was sharing as much as he wants.\\n\\n\"We are waiting for more details about their AI-related power consumption, the volume of their PPAs, the geographic distribution, the duration,\" Qi said.\\n\\nInvestors are also starting to ask more questions about so-called Scope 3 emissions which emerge from the supply chain.\\n\\nMicrosoft, Amazon and Nvidia declined to comment. Meta, Alphabet, Apple and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nA CHALLENGE\\n\\nThe challenge of increased demand for computing power and data centres is not lost on tech companies.\\n\\nMicrosoft, for example, said its supply chain emissions increased 30.9% in 2023, and Alphabet reported a 13% rise in total emissions, citing power and materials needs for data centers. Both said they were treating rising emissions as a challenge.\\n\\nMeta said this year it has been fully offsetting emissions from its operations since 2020 but the resources needed for AI will make it much harder to attain a goal of emitting no more greenhouse gas from its value chain in 2030 than can be offset.\\n\\nIn their most recent environmental reports, Amazon and Apple said their emissions were falling.

They also elevate their adopted and origin countries\\' standings in global value chains, contributing to economic resilience.\\n\\nWe are economists who study global trade and migration, and our recent work reveals that immigrants contribute far more to the economic fabric of nations than previously understood.\\n\\nBy facilitating what\\'s known as \"trade in value added,\" or TiVA, immigrants play a crucial role in helping countries specialize their production, move up the value chain and significantly enhance trade sophistication.\\n\\nMoving up the value chain means progressing from producing basic, low-value goods to more complex, higher-value products. This shift involves improving skills, technology and production techniques, allowing a country to capture more economic value and develop advanced industries.\\n\\nSo, what exactly is trade in value added, and why is it important?\\n\\nIn today\\'s global economy, products are rarely made entirely in one country. Instead, different stages of production occur across multiple nations. TiVA measures each country\\'s contribution to a final product, providing clearer insight into global value chains. For instance, while an iPhone may be assembled in China, its components come from various countries, each adding value.\\n\\nOur study found that a 10% increase in immigrants from a particular country residing in one of the 38 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member states leads to a 2.08% increase in the value added from their home country that becomes embedded in their host country\\'s exports to the world.\\n\\nThis effect was strongest in the services sector, followed closely by agriculture and manufacturing.\\n\\nTo understand how this works, consider Indian software engineers in Silicon Valley. Their understanding of the U.S. tech industry and India\\'s IT sector can lead to partnerships. These partnerships lead to Indian firms providing specialized coding services for American tech giants. The result? Higher-value U.S. tech exports that incorporate Indian expertise. This perfectly illustrates how immigrants boost trade in value added.\\n\\nOr take Chinese immigrants in Italy\\'s fashion industry. Their cultural knowledge might help Italian luxury brands tailor products for the Chinese market and connect Italian designers with highly skilled textile workers in China. The result? Italian fashion exports incorporate Chinese craftsmanship, elevating both countries\\' global fashion value chain positions.\\n\\nOur findings show that immigrants are pivotal bridges in global trade networks. They leverage their unique knowledge, skills and connections to strengthen economic bonds between nations. That\\'s in line with previous research showing the significant role immigrants play in fostering bilateral trade.\\n\\nIn an era of increasing skepticism toward globalization and migration, understanding the positive economic impacts of immigration is crucial. Our current and previous research, and the findings from related studies, indicate that rather than \"stealing jobs,\" immigrants often create value and new economic opportunities that might not otherwise exist.\\n\\nImmigrants bring diverse skills, knowledge and networks to their host countries that can enhance innovation, fill labor shortages and open new market opportunities. They often possess unique insights into their home country markets, helping host country firms navigate cultural nuances and business practices that might otherwise pose trade barriers.\\n\\nFor home countries, emigrants can serve as cultural ambassadors, creating awareness, showcasing products and services, and helping to integrate their homeland into global value chains. They may also contribute to knowledge transfer, investment flows and business connections that boost their home and host countries\\' economic development.\\n\\nMoreover, immigrants\\' ability to enhance trade in value added suggests they play a role in moving countries up the economic value chain. Rather than simply facilitating trade in raw materials or essential manufactured goods, immigrants appear to boost trade in more sophisticated, higher-value products and services. This is crucial for economic development, as countries that position themselves higher in global value chains tend to see bigger benefits.\\n\\nOur observations have important implications for both immigration and trade. For one, they suggest that restrictive immigration policies might have unintended consequences, hindering a country\\'s trade performance and position in global value chains. Countries that want to become more economically competitive might consider more open immigration policies.\\n\\nWhat\\'s more, our research indicates that immigrants\\' economic benefits extend beyond the often-cited labor-market and fiscal impacts - in other words, having more workers who pay more taxes.\\n\\nThe evidence suggests policymakers should take a more holistic view of immigration\\'s economic effects, considering its role in facilitating sophisticated international trade and value creation.\\n\\nOur results also align with previous research highlighting the potential value of workforce diversity for businesses, particularly for firms engaged in international trade. Employees from diverse national backgrounds can bring valuable insights and connections that help their companies navigate global markets and value chains.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that immigrants\\' impact on trade in value added varies across countries and sectors. This suggests that rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, targeted policies might most effectively leverage immigration for economic benefit.\\n\\nMaximizing immigration\\'s positive impacts on trade and value chains also requires supportive policies and institutions that allow immigrants to use their skills and networks fully. These might include programs to assist with economic integration, language training, credential recognition and support for immigrant entrepreneurship.\\n\\nAs the global economy continues to evolve, with value chains becoming ever more complex and interconnected, the role of immigrants as facilitators of trade and value creation is likely to grow even more significant.

The latest report analyzes post-closing quality control data derived from ACES Quality Management & Control® software.\\n\\nNotable findings from the Q1 2024 report include the following:\\n\\nThe overall critical defect rate increased 3.27% to 1.58% in Q1 2024, ending five quarters of decline.While Income/Employment remains the leading category of defects, performance improved tremendously quarter-over-quarter in this category.Defects increased in two of the four major underwriting categories, with Credit defects nearly doubling from Q4 2023.Legal/Regulatory/Compliance defects increased by 208.37% to 16.22%, becoming the second-highest category of defects this quarter, followed by Loan Documentation at 14.41%.Insurance defects, while usually negligible, comprised 8.11% of all defects.Although refinance review share declined this quarter, defect share doubled, indicating a degradation in quality in this area.Defect share outstripped review share for conventional loans this quarter, most certainly fueled by the surge in refinance defects.Both review share and defect share declined in the FHA category. Lenders also saw substantial improvements in VA defect share despite significantly increasing review share over Q4.\\n\\n\"Given origination levels in the first quarter of this year, the findings in this report showed greater changes than expected,\" said ACES Executive Vice President Nick Volpe. \"Historically, defect rates decrease when there is a decline in origination levels; however, that was not the case for Q1. Mortgage lenders are no strangers to market adversity. While the market is shifting, we hope this report will serve as a reminder to reinforce quality control across the board.\"\\n\\nFindings for the Q1 ACES Mortgage QC Industry Trends Report are based on post-closing quality control data derived from the ACES Quality Management and Control® benchmarking system and incorporate data from prior quarters and/or calendar years, where applicable. All reviews and defect data evaluated for the report were based on loan audits selected by lenders for full file reviews.\\n\\n\"The current mortgage market presents distinct challenges that lenders must navigate with precision. Although the critical defect rate remains low by historical standards, the increase in a quarter with record-low origination volumes is concerning. Notable rises across underwriting categories and unexpected insurance defects need closer scrutiny from lenders,\" said Trevor Gauthier, CEO of ACES Quality Management. \"Overall, the data clearly shows that lenders are under increasing pressure to maintain quality amid changing market dynamics. A proactive approach to quality control is crucial for mitigating risk and ensuring long-term stability.\"\\n\\nThe Mortgage QC Industry Trends Reports are available for download, free of charge, at https://www.acesquality.com/resources/reports.\\n\\nAbout ACES Quality Management:\\n\\nACES Quality Management is the leading provider of enterprise quality management and control software for the financial services industry.

Tech\\'s thirst for power is likely to go unabated because AI and cloud computing are important drivers of growth, although many expect data center efficiency to increase greatly.\\n\\nTech stocks became go-to picks for many such funds, because they made outsized market gains while producing fewer greenhouse gases than stocks in other sectors like manufacturing and energy.\\n\\nInvestments marketed with environmental, social and governance concerns in mind have lost some favor since a pandemic era boom. But there are still some $2.24 trillion in equity in one of the strictest ESG categories: funds that come under Article 8 and 9 funds under the European Union\\'s financial law, according to data firm Morningstar Direct. There was almost $30 trillion in global equity funds held as of last year.\\n\\nA review of the top holdings of the largest such funds shows they are now heavily invested in tech giants, including Apple , Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft , Meta and Nvidia.\\n\\nSome of those investments could be affected if the concerns are not addressed, the investors and analysts said.\\n\\n\"What we will do is make the AI angle a central part of our climate-related engagement with tech companies,\" said Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management.\\n\\nIf the companies were to loosen current commitments to source renewable energy now and in the future, managers may choose to exclude them from some of the more strictly-defined funds.\\n\\nThis would count against them achieving \"sustainable investment\" status, he said.\\n\\nAn Article 8 fund is meant to \"promote...environmental or social characteristics\" while an Article 9 fund \"has sustainable investment as its objective,\" EU rules say.\\n\\nPedersen called AI \"one of the biggest potential shifts in the standard composition\" of a sustainable fund.\\n\\n\"Where we have committed a proportion to sustainable investments in our internal ESG scoring, you might see it becoming harder for those companies to fulfill that,\" he said.\\n\\nNordea\\'s 265 billion euros ($291.7 billion) under management includes a total investment of about 17 billion euros in Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, NVIDIA and Meta shares.\\n\\nJason Qi, senior ESG research analyst for Morgan Stanley\\'s Calvert Research and Management, said he had been asking the firms for more information about current energy use. Qi cited Microsoft as a leader in disclosing data like power supply deals (PPAs), but said no company was sharing as much as he wants.\\n\\n\"We are waiting for more details about their AI-related power consumption, the volume of their PPAs, the geographic distribution, the duration,\" Qi said.\\n\\nInvestors are also starting to ask more questions about so-called Scope 3 emissions which emerge from the supply chain.\\n\\nMicrosoft, Amazon and Nvidia declined to comment. Meta, Alphabet, Apple and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nThe challenge of increased demand for computing power and data centers is not lost on tech companies.\\n\\nMicrosoft, for example, said its supply chain emissions increased 30.9% in 2023, and Alphabet reported a 13% rise in total emissions, citing power and materials needs for data centers. Both said they were treating rising emissions as a challenge.\\n\\nMeta said this year it has been fully offsetting emissions from its operations since 2020 but the resources needed for AI will make it much harder to attain a goal of emitting no more greenhouse gas from its value chain in 2030 than can be offset.\\n\\nIn their most recent environmental reports, Amazon and Apple said their emissions were falling. Calvert\\'s Qi said the power needs would be concentrated at different parts of the supply chain at different stages in AI development, so while data centers need a lot of power now, other companies could bear more of the load in future. AI proponents say the technology could eventually help make other sectors more energy efficient.\\n\\nOne sign the companies are trying to power the boom with low-carbon energy is increasing investment in nuclear.\\n\\nAmazon said this year it was starting to buy nuclear power to supplement renewables. And Microsoft said last week it had signed a deal to help resurrect a mothballed nuclear plant in Pennsylvania in the first restart of its kind in history.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Swedish bank Handelsbanken, which offers two Article 9 funds that track indexes with Google and Microsoft among their top five holdings, said improving sustainability data is making it easier to identify where portfolios need adjusting.\\n\\nThe Article 9 funds are built with the aim of showing a 7% average reduction in carbon emissions from all the constituent stocks combined every year, \"which means that over time companies that increase their carbon emissions will likely receive a lower weight in the fund,\" said Aurora Samuelsson, head of sustainability at Handelsbanken Asset Management.\\n\\n\"We raise and will raise the relevant and material issues in our dialog with the companies,\" Samuelsson said.', 'source': {'uri': 'theglobeandmail.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Globe and Mail'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/NQ5SG4BYINBYJFPK4PPY3EZQUQ.JPG?auth=0da023a9286141194eb8d8e2d8dbb4d1fa3eacb975f4064037f26b6576ed6c7a&width=560&quality=80', 'eventUri': 'eng-9942552', 'sentiment': 0.4352941176470588, 'wgt': 253, 'relevance': 26}, {'uri': '2024-09-488509621', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-09-18', 'time': '05:32:49', 'dateTime': '2024-09-18T05:32:49Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-09-18T05:31:55Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9882352948188782, 'url': 'https://www.streetinsider.com/PRNewswire/CellPoint+Digital+Promotes+Internal+Talent+to+Chief+Financial+Officer%2C+Reinforcing+Growth+Strategy/23734289.html', 'title': 'CellPoint Digital Promotes Internal Talent to Chief Financial Officer, Reinforcing Growth Strategy', 'body': 'Long-standing team member Alexander Stephens steps into key leadership role, bringing deep company knowledge and financial expertise\\n\\nLONDON, Sept. 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CellPoint Digital, the leading global provider of Payment Orchestration solutions for travel, today announced the promotion of Alexander Stephens to Chief Financial Officer.

Venture capitalists divided on Harris or Trump', 'body': 'LOS ANGELES -- Being a venture capitalist carries a lot of prestige in Silicon Valley. Those who choose which startups to fund see themselves as fostering the next big waves of technology.\\n\\nSo when some of the industry\\'s biggest names endorsed former President Donald Trump and the onetime VC he picked for a running mate, JD Vance, people took notice.\\n\\nThen hundreds of other VCs -- some high profile, others lesser-known -- threw their weight behind Vice President Kamala Harris, drawing battle lines over which presidential candidate will be better for tech innovation and the conditions startups need to thrive. For years, many of Silicon Valley\\'s political discussions took place behind closed doors. Now, those casual debates have gone public -- on podcasts, social media and online manifestos.\\n\\nVenture capitalist and Harris backer Stephen DeBerry says some of his best friends support Trump. Though centered in a part of Northern California known for liberal politics, the investors who help finance the tech industry have long been a more politically divided bunch.\\n\\n\"We ski together. Our families are together. We\\'re super tight,\" said DeBerry, who runs the Bronze Venture Fund. \"This is not about not being able to talk to each other. I love these guys -- they\\'re almost all guys. They\\'re dear friends. We just have a difference of perspective on policy issues.\"\\n\\nIt remains to be seen if the more than 700 venture capitalists who\\'ve voiced support for a movement called \"VCs for Kamala\" will match the pledges of Trump\\'s well-heeled supporters such as Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. But the effort marks \"the first time I\\'ve seen a galvanized group of folks from our industry coming together and coalescing around our shared values,\" DeBerry said.\\n\\n\"There are a lot of practical reasons for VCs to support Trump,\" including policies that could drive corporate profits and stock market values and favor wealthy benefactors, said David Cowan, an investor at Bessemer Venture Partners. But Cowan said he is supporting Harris as a VC with a \"long-term investment horizon\" because a \"Trump world reeling from rampant income inequality, raging wars and global warming is not an attractive environment\" for funding healthy businesses.\\n\\nSeveral prominent VCs have voiced their support for Trump on Musk\\'s social platform X. Public records show some of them have donated to a new, pro-Trump super PAC called America PAC, whose donors include powerful tech industry conservatives with ties to SpaceX and Paypal and who run in Musk\\'s social circle. Also driving support is Trump\\'s embrace of cryptocurrency and promise to end an enforcement crackdown on the industry.\\n\\nAlthough some Biden policies have alienated parts of the investment sector concerned about tax policy, antitrust scrutiny or overregulation, Harris\\' bid for the presidency has reenergized interest from VCs who until recently sat on the sidelines. Some of that excitement is due to existing relationships with Silicon Valley that are borne out of Harris\\' career in the San Francisco area and her time as California\\'s attorney general.\\n\\n\"We buy risk, right? And we\\'re trying to buy the right type of risk,\" Leslie Feinzaig, founder of \"VCs for Kamala\" said in an interview. \"It\\'s really hard for these companies that are trying to build products and scale to do so in an unpredictable institutional environment.\"\\n\\nThe schism in tech has left some firms split in their allegiances. Although venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, founders of the firm that is their namesake, endorsed Trump, one of their firm\\'s general partners, John O\\'Farrell, pledged his support for Harris. O\\'Farrell declined further comment.\\n\\nDoug Leone, the former managing partner of Sequoia Capital, endorsed Trump in June, expressing concern on X \"about the general direction of our country, the state of our broken immigration system, the ballooning deficit, and the foreign policy missteps, among other issues.\" But Leone\\'s longtime business partner at Sequoia, Michael Moritz, wrote in the Financial Times that tech leaders supporting Trump \"are making a big mistake.\"\\n\\nShaun Maguire, a partner at Sequoia, posted on X that he donated $300,000 to Trump\\'s campaign after supporting Hilary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Federal Election Commission records show that Maguire donated $500,000 to America PAC in June; Leone donated $1 million.\\n\\n\"The area where I disagree with Republicans the most is on women\\'s rights. And I\\'m sure I\\'ll disagree with some of Trump\\'s policies in the future,\" Maguire wrote. \"But in general I think he was surprisingly prescient.\"\\n\\nFeinzaig, managing director at venture firm Graham & Walker, said that she launched \"VCs for Kamala\" because she felt frustrated that \"the loudest voices\" were starting to \"sound like they were speaking for the entire industry.\"\\n\\nMuch of the VC discourse about elections is in response to a July podcast and manifesto in which Andreessen and Horowitz backed Trump and outlined their vision of a \"Little Tech Agenda\" that they said contrasted with the policies sought by Big Tech.\\n\\nThey accused the U.S. government of increasing hostility toward startups and the VCs who fund them, citing Biden\\'s proposed higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations and regulations they said could hobble emerging industries involving blockchain and artificial intelligence.\\n\\nVance, a U.S. senator from Ohio who spent time in San Francisco working at Thiel\\'s investment firm, voiced a similar perspective about \"little tech\" more than a month before he was chosen as Trump\\'s running mate.\\n\\n\"The donors who were really involved in Silicon Valley in a pro-Trump way, they\\'re not big tech, right? They\\'re little tech. They\\'re starting innovative companies. They don\\'t want the government to destroy their ability to innovate,\" Vance said in an interview on Fox News in June.\\n\\nDays earlier, Vance had joined Trump at a San Francisco fundraiser at the home of venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks, a longtime conservative. Vance said Trump spoke to about 100 attendees that included \"some of the leading innovators in AI.\"\\n\\nDeBerry said he doesn\\'t disagree with everything Andreesen Horowitz founders espouse, particularly their wariness about powerful companies controlling the agencies that regulate them. But he objects to their \"little tech\" framing, especially coming from a multibillion-dollar investment firm that he says is hardly the voice of the little guy. For DeBerry, whose firm focuses on social impact, the choice is not between big and little tech but \"chaos and stability,\" with Harris representing stability.\\n\\nComplicating the allegiances is that a tough approach to breaking up the monopoly power of big corporations no longer falls along partisan lines. Vance has spoken favorably of Lina Khan, who Biden picked to lead the Federal Trade Commission and has taken on several tech giants. Meanwhile, some of the most influential VCs backing Harris -- such as LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman; and Sun Microsystems co-founder Vinod Khosla, an early investor in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI -- have sharply criticized Khan\\'s approach.\\n\\nU.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat whose California district encompasses part of Silicon Valley, said Trump supporters are a vocal minority reflecting a \"third or less\" of the region\\'s tech community. But while the White House has appealed to tech entrepreneurs with its investments in clean energy, electric vehicles and semiconductors, Khanna said Democrats must do a better job of showing that they understand the appeal of digital assets.\\n\\n\"I do think that the perceived lack of embrace of Bitcoin and the blockchain has hurt the Democratic Party among the young generation and among young entrepreneurs,\" Khanna said.\\n\\nNaseem Sayani, a general partner at Emmeline Ventures, said Andreessen and Horowitz\\'s support of Trump became a lightning rod for those in tech who do not back the Republican nominee. Sayani signed onto \"VCs for Kamala,\" she said, because she wanted the types of businesses that she helps fund to know that the investor community is not monolithic.\\n\\n\"We\\'re not single-profile founders anymore,\" she said. \"There\\'s women, there\\'s people of color, there\\'s all the intersections. How can they feel comfortable building businesses when the environment they\\'re in doesn\\'t actually support their existence in some ways?\"', 'source': {'uri': 'washingtontimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Washington Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'sarah_parvini@washingtontimes.com', 'name': 'Sarah Parvini', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/09/15/Trump_Harris_Silicon_Valley_99046_c0-186-4457-2784_s1770x1032.jpg?513a5cac759c6db771978da2111c7eb02827215f', 'eventUri': 'eng-9906135', 'sentiment': 0.2862745098039217, 'wgt': 252, 'relevance': 5}]\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mHere are the most important insights from the recent news articles about Nvidia and the semiconductor industry:\n",

The FinTech Rankings evaluate the top 100 providers of financial technology based on 2023 calendar year revenues from the financial services and FinTech industries. In related news, Experian (OTC:EXPGF) is also an IDC Real Results Award winner, ranking in the top spot for Bank Deposit Transformation.\\n\\nThe Real Results Awards recognize IT providers that have enabled a genuine, measurable and future-enabling change at a client financial institution (bank, capital markets firm, or insurer) in the worldwide financial services industry. The Bank Deposit Transformation award was based on customer data and their use of the Experian Ascend Fraud Sandbox.\\n\\nPlacing first for Bank Deposit Transformation demonstrates how this new Experian fraud solution enables our customers to use state-of-the-art fraud-prevention and identity-protection technology to dramatically improve approval rates for online deposit accounts, directly impacting their bottom line while simultaneously lowering fraud losses, said Alex Lintner, Chief Executive Officer of Experian Software Solutions. \"These honors underscore our delivery of advanced modeling and comprehensive data insights that advance and accelerate our customers\\' business.

The survey polled 1,000 respondents across Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam and India, and found that 81% of Asian tech professionals view the UAE as a growing tech hub. A further 76% of respondents say the UAE provides a conducive environment for the tech industry.\\n\\nTarik Chebib, CEO, Middle East, Capital.com\\n\\nThe UAE\\'s growing reputation as a burgeoning tech hub is fuelling interest among tech workers across the region, with nearly half (45%) of respondents expressing a willingness to relocate to the UAE for work, out-ranking countries like Germany (38%) and Hong Kong (20%) as popular relocation destinations.\\n\\nThis places the UAE in close competition with other prominent destinations such as Singapore (46%), the UK (57%), and the US (52%) as preferred locations for relocation among tech professionals.\\n\\nCommenting on the findings, Tarik Chebib, CEO, Capital.com, Middle East, said:\\n\\n\"With 8 in 10 respondents from our recent survey recognising the UAE as a competitive tech hub, it\\'s clear that the region is gaining momentum as a favourable destination for tech talent. Asia\\'s tech professionals have traditionally gravitated to cities in the UK, the US and Singapore to further their careers, so it\\'s encouraging to see the UAE stand shoulder-to-shoulder with this cohort and get the recognition it deserves as an attractive location to live and work.\"\\n\\nGovernment support is the key factor contributing to UAE\\'s growing reputation as a tech hub and relocation destination of choice.

The UAE\\'s business-friendly environment, forward-thinking policies, investment in innovation, and position as a gateway to the Middle East, Africa and Asia, makes it an ideal location for companies and talent alike. Capital.com is proud to contribute to the sector\\'s growth and innovation in the UAE.\" said Chebib.\\n\\nWhile all respondents indicated a \\'willingness\\' to relocate for work, 47% indicated that they are \\'actively\\' looking to relocate, highlighting the huge potential for the UAE to attract and retain tech talent.\\n\\n\"As a company operating in the UAE that is licensed by the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), we need to draw on an exceptional pool of talent to meet our exacting business and regulatory needs. This means searching for the best talent, from anywhere in the world.

(HLI), a global leader since 2013 in advancing precision medicine in the pursuit of healthy aging, often referred to as longevity medicine. The investment will support the company\\'s growth within the U.S. market, as well as its expansion into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Southeast Asia.\\n\\nFounded by Dr. J. Craig Venter, one of the pioneers of the human genome sequencing effort, HLI builds on his vision for a longer, healthier life and the democratization of genomics to revolutionize the way we evade \"avoidable disease\" and stay healthy longer. The company is recognized as a leader in the rapidly expanding industry of longevity medicine due to its deep expertise in genomics and other fields of precision medicine such as imaging, and its unmatched, longitudinal patient dataset built on decades of research in the field. The company has proprietary tools for the detection of gene-disease associations, including HLI\\'s artificial intelligence health risk and recommendation platform, and provides its clients with pre-symptomatic diagnosis and customized treatments, preempting disease at a very early stage and maximizing health outcomes. In short, HLI is transforming healthcare from a reactive practice to one that is predictive, proactive, and preventative, which not only enhances the quality of lives of individuals but improves the efficiency and efficacy of the entire healthcare system.\\n\\nTVM Capital Healthcare brings extensive global investment experience combined with operating experience in the Middle East and Southeast Asia and a track record of building innovative healthcare companies. Through this investment provided by the Saudi Arabia-focused TVM Healthcare Afiyah Fund LP, which closed earlier this year and is the largest growth capital fund of its kind in the region, the firm will support HLI in its expansion, initially with a special focus on market entry in the Kingdom. The country\\'s Vision 2030 and Health Sector Transformation Program call for an evolution of \"sick care\" to true \"health care,\" focusing on the most critical fields of oncology, neurology, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and autoimmune disease. Saudi Arabia is highly receptive to healthcare business models such as HLI and has been increasingly active in longevity science with several government-backed initiatives, including the Saudi Human Genome Program and the Hevolution Foundation, a Riyadh-headquartered global non-profit organisation, investing in scientific projects and life science companies in the longevity field.\\n\\nDr. J. Craig Venter, Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Advisor of Human Longevity, Inc., commented: \"Human Longevity, Inc. is a health firm where the goal is to stay ahead of aging and illness. We believe this platform will save millions of lives and significantly reduce healthcare costs in the future. TVM Capital Healthcare\\'s investment enables us to strengthen our position globally as the most data-backed longevity practice, as well as establishes our foothold in markets, like Saudi Arabia and SEA, that see the potential of our approach in preventive medicine and the huge impact it will have on changing the cost of medicine.\"\\n\\nDr. Helmut M. Schuehsler, Chairman and CEO of TVM Capital Healthcare, remarked: \"With our investment in HLI, we contribute to the transition towards the \\'healthcare of the future\\' which is all about precision medicine, personalized care, and disease prevention, in short: true \\'health care.\\' The potential long-term impact of longevity medicine in society is immense. We are excited to be part of the journey through this new investment which supports the growth of the company in the U.S., but also introduces HLI into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Southeast Asia.\"\\n\\nDr. Ghida Harfouche, Partner at TVM Capital Healthcare, added: \"HLI\\'s cutting-edge science has enabled precision medicine for disease prevention and highly personalized interventions for their clients. We are pleased we can support the company in its global growth, and work with them on democratization of healthy longevity and preventative care.\"\\n\\nTVM Capital Healthcare is recognized as the first international Healthcare fund manager investing in and operating healthcare companies in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The firm is also active across the wider Middle East and Southeast Asia. In addition to backing healthcare growth companies in the U.S. and Europe to support their expansion plans into these regions, TVM Capital Healthcare also invests in leading local companies. With this two-pronged, highly catalytic strategy, TVM Capital Healthcare improves quality and affordable access to world-leading products, technologies, and services across its target markets.\\n\\nTVM Capital Healthcare is a global healthcare private equity firm specializing in emerging markets.

The benchmark S&P 500 index, Nasdaq and Dow are on track for their biggest daily declines since early August.\\n\\nShares of chip stocks were hard hit, with AI heavyweight Nvidia tumbling nearly 10% and Wall Street\\'s chip index the PHLX chip index slumping 8%.\\n\\nTODD SOHN, ETF STRATEGIST, STRATEGAS LLC, NEW YORK:\\n\\n\"Such a massive amount of money has gone to tech and semiconductors in the last 12 months that the trade is completely skewed. Since the Fed paused rate increases a year ago, more than $30 billion has flowed into U.S. technology-related ETFs; meanwhile all other sector ETFs lost $10 billion in the same time period. Tactical allocations go into those sector ETFs, and imbalances like this can persist for a while, but eventually, the steam runs out of the trade.\\n\\n\"Then there are the earnings - it\\'s also hard to keep beating those high expectations. Plus, now we have Broadcom\\'s results due Thursday. And if you put ten people in a room and asked them why this is happening, at least one would point to the election and the possibility that a new administration would do something to tariffs that would affect chips.\\n\\n\"Finally, while it wouldn\\'t be at the top of my list, there\\'s the calendar. People may have woken up this morning and realized it\\'s September, which historically is not a great month for stocks. Add to that the fact that so far this year the largest drawdown we\\'ve seen in the S&P 500 is about 8%, and that typically we\\'d see something around 14%, people are nervous.\"\\n\\nSTEVE SOSNICK, MARKET STRATEGIST, INTERACTIVE BROKERS, GREENWICH, CT.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a bit of a post-Nvidia earnings hangover going on today. Those earnings last week were fine; they exceeded expectations. But the magnitude of the beats is shrinking quarter by quarter and that\\'s not lost on investors. The stock had rallied going into earnings - a huge amount of investment poured into it - and so it wasn\\'t just sufficient to be good, it had to be great. And Friday\\'s rally took place in remarkably light volume ahead of a long weekend that happened to coincide with the end of the month, so the typical markup that happens at the end of a calendar month met no resistance.\\n\\n\"This week is different, and so you\\'ve seen a nasty day. There\\'s concern about what the job numbers are going to show, about seasonality. That\\'s why the VIX is higher. I don\\'t think the ISM number, showing a weaker manufacturing sector but higher prices, was at all helpful. And there you have it. Gravity.\"\\n\\nDENNIS DICK, TRADER AT TRIPLE D TRADING:\\n\\n\"If you look at the action on Friday, everything was rallying, but Nvidia was lagging. So, you could see the relative strength was poor after their earnings print. It hasn\\'t been good since then.\"\\n\\n\"September is seasonally a very weak month of the year, so I think people are nervous. People are just using this as an excuse to take profits and the most likely candidates to take profits are the semis, because they\\'ve been the strongest.\"\\n\\nSTEPHEN MASSOCCA, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, WEDBUSH SECURITIES, SAN FRANCISCO:\\n\\n\"We ran right back up to the new high again. There was absolutely zero news over the weekend that meant anything to anybody. But here we are down 600 points.\"\\n\\n\"They\\'re expensive. They\\'re not cheap stocks. I mean, wow, I don\\'t know what Nvidia needed to do in the quarter... It was a pretty freaking good quarter, a couple minor issues, but it just goes to show you these things are just very expensive.\\n\\n\"It also becomes a little bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy because so much money now flows into ETFs and so much money flows into S&P and target funds and all that. It just gets spread across the market and it gets spread across the market on a market cap weighted basis, so it sort of becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you\\'re one of the top market cap names in the S&P 500 and all the money is pouring into S&P 500 ETFs funds, how does that not help you? And I think that\\'s part of it, and that\\'s part of why you get these stretched valuations.\"\\n\\nBRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ANNEX WEALTH MANAGEMENT, BROOKFIELD, WI\\n\\n\"People are worrying and thinking about all kinds of macro issues. Has the Fed fumbled the ball? The fear is that it is tripping over its own feet when it comes to the timing and pace of rate cuts instead of sticking the landing. Will the jobs report increase the odds of a recession? The biggest thing here is the possibility that investors will sell what has gone up the most in the face of any softening.\"\\n\\nSCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST AT WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE\\n\\n\"We came in with the futures down but once this ISM number came out it triggered this fall.\"\\n\\n\"The market is worried about how drastic the slowdown is going to be. The tech sector, even with this pullback we\\'ve had today, it\\'s still up a lot for the year and these things have moved a lot. These stocks led the chart up and on down days they will lead the chart down. When you look at something like 2/10 inversions the last 8 recessions curve has gone positive before recession occurs and we\\'re only a few basis points away. The market is thinking about that too.\"\\n\\nMICHAEL GREEN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SIMPLIFY, SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA\\n\\n\"People are over allocated to Nvidia and many of these names and they\\'re trying to reduce that exposure. It just has the potential for these things to sell off quite significantly\"\\n\\n\"I also think there is a derisking related to election as the election season officially starts now when people are back from Labor Day and everybody is off the beach. Everybody looked at their portfolios and said that going into the political uncertainty of a tight election, we want to have less risk. The PMI report was an excuse for that.\"\\n\\nCALLIE COX, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, RITHOLTZ WEALTH MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK\\n\\n\"Stocks are starting the fall off on a sour note, yet it\\'s hard to say exactly why people are selling today. Tech is dragging the index down, with Nvidia accounting for about a third of the S&P 500\\'s losses. We saw a manufacturing report come out this morning that suggests goods demand is slowing. But it wasn\\'t shockingly bad data, and the narrative of slowing demand isn\\'t exactly surprising.\\n\\n\"I\\'d pin some of the drop on seasonality. September is typically a rough month of the year for the stock market - and the S&P 500 has fallen on the Tuesday after Labor Day every year since 2016. People may simply just be catching up to what they missed during the dog days of summer.\\n\\n\"Believe in this bull market, but shield yourself against rash decisions in what could be a turbulent fall. And don\\'t get distracted by short-term market swings. Since 1950, 60% of market selloffs haven\\'t reached correction territory, and 26% have ended before the dreaded bear market level.\"\\n\\n(Reporting by Suzanne McGee, Noel Randewich, Chuck Mikolajczak, Chibuike Oguh, David Randall, Laura Matthews and Carolina Mandl; Compiled by Megan Davies)', 'source': {'uri': 'ca.finance.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo!

Tech\\'s thirst for power is likely to go unabated because AI and cloud computing are important drivers of growth, although many expect data center efficiency to increase greatly.\\n\\nTech stocks became go-to picks for many such funds, because they made outsized market gains while producing fewer greenhouse gases than stocks in other sectors like manufacturing and energy.\\n\\nInvestments marketed with environmental, social and governance concerns in mind have lost some favour since a pandemic era boom. But there are still some $2.24 trillion in equity in one of the strictest ESG categories: funds that come under Article 8 and 9 funds under the European Union\\'s financial law, according to data firm Morningstar Direct. There was almost $30 trillion in global equity funds held as of last year.\\n\\nA review of the top holdings of the largest such funds shows they are now heavily invested in tech giants, including Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Nvidia.\\n\\nSome of those investments could be affected if the concerns are not addressed, the investors and analysts said.\\n\\n\"What we will do is make the AI angle a central part of our climate-related engagement with tech companies,\" said Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management.\\n\\nIf the companies were to loosen current commitments to source renewable energy now and in the future, managers may choose to exclude them from some of the more strictly-defined funds.\\n\\nThis would count against them achieving \"sustainable investment\" status, he said.\\n\\nAn Article 8 fund is meant to \"promote...environmental or social characteristics\" while an Article 9 fund \"has sustainable investment as its objective,\" EU rules say.\\n\\nPedersen called AI \"one of the biggest potential shifts in the standard composition\" of a sustainable fund.\\n\\n\"Where we have committed a proportion to sustainable investments in our internal ESG scoring, you might see it becoming harder for those companies to fulfil that,\" he said.\\n\\nNordea\\'s 265 billion euros ($291.7 billion) under management includes a total investment of about 17 billion euros in Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, NVIDIA and Meta shares.\\n\\nJason Qi, senior ESG research analyst for Morgan Stanley\\'s Calvert Research and Management, said he had been asking the firms for more information about current energy use. Qi cited Microsoft as a leader in disclosing data like power supply deals (PPAs), but said no company was sharing as much as he wants.\\n\\n\"We are waiting for more details about their AI-related power consumption, the volume of their PPAs, the geographic distribution, the duration,\" Qi said.\\n\\nInvestors are also starting to ask more questions about so-called Scope 3 emissions which emerge from the supply chain.\\n\\nMicrosoft, Amazon and Nvidia declined to comment. Meta, Alphabet, Apple and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nThe challenge of increased demand for computing power and data centres is not lost on tech companies.\\n\\nMicrosoft, for example, said its supply chain emissions increased 30.9% in 2023, and Alphabet reported a 13% rise in total emissions, citing power and materials needs for data centers. Both said they were treating rising emissions as a challenge.\\n\\nMeta said this year it has been fully offsetting emissions from its operations since 2020 but the resources needed for AI will make it much harder to attain a goal of emitting no more greenhouse gas from its value chain in 2030 than can be offset.\\n\\nIn their most recent environmental reports, Amazon and Apple said their emissions were falling. Calvert\\'s Qi said the power needs would be concentrated at different parts of the supply chain at different stages in AI development, so while data centers need a lot of power now, other companies could bear more of the load in future. AI proponents say the technology could eventually help make other sectors more energy efficient.\\n\\nOne sign the companies are trying to power the boom with low-carbon energy is increasing investment in nuclear.\\n\\nAmazon said this year it was starting to buy nuclear power to supplement renewables. And Microsoft said last week it had signed a deal to help resurrect a mothballed nuclear plant in Pennsylvania in the first restart of its kind in history.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Swedish bank Handelsbanken, which offers two Article 9 funds that track indexes with Google and Microsoft among their top five holdings, said improving sustainability data is making it easier to identify where portfolios need adjusting.\\n\\nThe Article 9 funds are built with the aim of showing a 7% average reduction in carbon emissions from all the constituent stocks combined every year, \"which means that over time companies that increase their carbon emissions will likely receive a lower weight in the fund,\" said Aurora Samuelsson, head of sustainability at Handelsbanken Asset Management.\\n\\n\"We raise and will raise the relevant and material issues in our dialogue with the companies,\" Samuelsson said.\\n\\n(Reporting by Isla Binnie; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Anna Driver)', 'source': {'uri': 'theprint.in', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'ThePrint'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'reuters@theprint.in', 'name': 'Reuters', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/theprint_default_image_new.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-9942552', 'sentiment': 0.2313725490196079, 'wgt': 250, 'relevance': 100}, {'uri': '2024-09-487512049', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-09-17', 'time': '07:45:40', 'dateTime': '2024-09-17T07:45:40Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-09-17T06:52:28Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9803921580314636, 'url': 'https://www.register-herald.com/news/nation_world/stock-market-today-asian-shares-are-mixed-as-wall-street-gears-up-for-an-interest/article_bc428e7e-9dbe-5cbf-ad0e-bbcf57475f28.html', 'title': 'Stock market today: Asian shares are mixed as Wall Street gears up for an interest rate cut', 'body': 'Shares were mixed in Asia on Tuesday as world markets geared up for the Federal Reserve\\'s most anticipated meeting in years.\\n\\nTokyo\\'s Nikkei index fell 1% to 36,203.22 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong advanced 1.3% to 17,654.79.\\n\\nMarkets in mainland China and South Korea were closed.\\n\\nAustralia\\'s S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.2% to 8,140.90.\\n\\nTraders are eagerly awaiting the Fed\\'s decision Wednesday on interest rates.

United States Steel became the first $1 billion company in 1901. General Motors then rode the automotive revolution to become the first $10 billion company in 1955. In 2018, Apple became the first to cross the $1 trillion milestone thanks to the success of its iPhone.\\n\\nApple remains the world's largest company with a $3.3 trillion market capitalization, but it has since been joined in the trillion-dollar club by tech giants Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet.\\n\\nBroadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) might be set to join them. It's currently valued at $761 billion, so its stock only needs to gain 31.4% from here to earn its membership. Here's why I think it will happen.\\n\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\n\\nBroadcom stock has soared recently, prompting a split\\n\\nBroadcom was originally a semiconductor and electronics company, but since merging with Avago Technologies in 2016, it has been on an acquisition spree. It spent a total of nearly $100 billion buying semiconductor equipment company CA Technologies in 2018, cybersecurity giant Symantec in 2019, and cloud software developer VMware in 2023.\\n\\nThe acquisitions have propelled Broadcom stock to a 465% gain over the last five years and, earlier this year, it soared past $1,800, which made it somewhat inaccessible to investors with small portfolios. As a result, Broadcom's management team decided to execute a 10-for-1 stock split, which increased the number of shares in circulation tenfold and reduced the price per share by a proportional amount.\\n\\nThe split went into effect on July 12, so investors can now buy one share of Broadcom for just $162 as of this writing. That spells an opportunity because the company's growing presence in artificial intelligence (AI) could drive further upside from here.\\n\\nA multifaceted artificial intelligence company\\n\\nBroadcom has placed a heavy focus on AI across its organization over the past year to capture what could be one of the most valuable technological revolutions in history.\\n\\nOn the semiconductor side, Broadcom makes data center accelerators, which are specially designed chips for AI development. It also supplies networking equipment for data centers, including Ethernet switches that regulate how quickly data travels from one point to another. High-quality switches are critical to AI infrastructure, because data needs to rapidly flow through tens of thousands of graphics processors (GPUs) and accelerators.\\n\\nDuring the recent third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Aug. 4), Broadcom said its custom AI accelerators segment grew by three-and-a-half times compared to the year-ago period thanks to surging demand from hyperscalers (which typically includes Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet). The company also said its Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI switches delivered fourfold sales growth compared to the year-ago period.\\n\\nOutside of the semiconductor business, Symantec is weaving AI into its cybersecurity products. For example, it launched SymantecAI earlier this year, which is a chatbot capable of answering users' queries about their endpoint protection.\\n\\nThen, there is VMware, which serves as the software layer of the data center to help organizations optimize their infrastructure. They can use VMware to create virtual machines, meaning multiple employees can plug into the same server to utilize all of its capacity. That ensures no computing capacity goes to waste, which is critical right now due to the short supply of high-powered GPUs and data center hardware.\\n\\nBroadcom expects to deliver $51.5 billion in total revenue for the entirety of fiscal 2024, which will wrap up at the end of October. The company's guidance initially suggested $11 billion of that would be attributable to AI across its businesses, but it just raised that estimate to $12 billion, which highlights the significant momentum in this emerging space.\\n\\nBroadcom's (mathematical) path to the $1 trillion club\\n\\nAs I touched on at the top, Broadcom has a market cap of $761 billion right now, so its stock only needs to gain 31.4% from here to place the company in the $1 trillion club.\\n\\nThe company isn't consistently profitable on a GAAP basis, so it can't be valued using the traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. However, we can value it using the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, which divides its market cap by its annual revenue.\\n\\nBroadcom currently trades at a P/S ratio of 16. If that number remains constant, the company simply has to grow its annual revenue by 31.4% to justify its entry into the $1 trillion club. Wall Street expects Broadcom's revenue to grow by 17.2% in fiscal 2025, which won't be enough, but it could get there in fiscal 2026 if it can grow by that amount again.\\n\\nThere is a caveat. Although Broadcom's P/S ratio is down from its peak of around 19, it's still very expensive compared to its average of 8.7 over the last five years:\\n\\nAVGO PS Ratio data by YCharts\\n\\nIt's clear why investors are willing to pay a premium for the stock right now -- Broadcom's AI semiconductor products are delivering explosive growth, and its acquisitions are adding a tremendous amount of value. However, there is no guarantee investors will be receptive to such a high P/S ratio over the long term, and a reduction back to its five-year average could add years to Broadcom's quest to join the $1 trillion club.\\n\\nTherefore, while Broadcom will be a spectacular stock to own during the AI revolution, investors should maintain a very long-term outlook (perhaps of a decade or more) if they buy it today. That will give the company plenty of time to grow into its current valuation.\\n\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Broadcom wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\\n\\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $708,348!*\\n\\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Under the August 2023 Equity Distribution Agreement, the Company may, from time to time, sell up to $90 million of common shares in the capital of the Company (\"the August 2023 ATM Equity Program\"). The August 2023 Equity Distribution Agreement was terminated on July 19, 2024.\\n\\nFor the period from July 1, 2024, to July 19, 2024 (the \"Terminal Period\"), the Company issued 1,368,297 common shares (the \"August 2023 ATM Shares\") pursuant to the August 2023 ATM Equity Program for gross proceeds of C$6.09 million ($4.46 million). The August 2023 ATM shares were sold at prevailing market prices, for an average price per August 2023 ATM Share of C$4.45. Pursuant to the August 2023 Equity Distribution Agreement, a cash commission of $133,735 on the aggregate gross proceeds raised was paid to the agent in connection with its services under the August 2023 Equity Distribution Agreement.\\n\\nThe Company is using the net proceeds from the August 2023 Equity Distribution Agreement for the purchase of data center equipment, strategic investments including building BTC assets on our balance sheet and general working capital.\\n\\nAbout HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.\\n\\nHIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. went public in 2017 as the first cryptocurrency mining company listed for trading on the TSX Venture Exchange with a focus on sustainable green energy.\\n\\nHIVE is a growth-oriented technology stock in the emergent blockchain industry. As a company whose shares trade on a major stock exchange, we are building a bridge between the digital currency and blockchain sector and traditional capital markets. HIVE owns and operates state-of-the-art, green energy- powered data centre facilities in Canada, Sweden, and Iceland, where we endeavour to source green energy to mine digital assets such as Bitcoin on the cloud. Since the beginning of 2021, HIVE has held in secure storage the majority of its treasury of BTC derived from mining rewards. Our shares provide investors with exposure to the operating margins of digital currency mining, as well as a portfolio of Bitcoin. Because HIVE also owns hard assets such as data centers and advanced multi-use servers, we believe our shares offer investors an attractive way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency space.\\n\\nHIVE\\'s unique value proposition encompasses efficient operations, a proven agile management team, financial strength, environmental sustainability, and innovative expansion strategies. Beyond Bitcoin mining, HIVE is firmly part of the global boom in data center infrastructure, sourcing primarily green renewable energy.\\n\\nHIVE presents a unique growth opportunity with over 2,500 Bitcoins on its balance sheet and growing revenue from its suite of Nvidia GPU chips powering data services for the AI revolution.\\n\\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release\\n\\nForward-Looking Information\\n\\nExcept for the statements of historical fact, this news release contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of the applicable Canadian and United States securities legislation and regulations that is based on expectations, estimates and projections as at the date of this news release. \"Forward-looking information\" in this news release includes but is not limited to: business goals and objectives of the Company;

Wall Street has a new hot trend, and its name is stock-split euphoria.\\n\\nA stock split allows publicly traded companies the ability to adjust their share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. However, these changes are purely superficial and don\\'t impact a company\\'s market cap or its operating performance.\\n\\nSince 2024 began, 13 outstanding companies have announced and/or completed a stock split, including (all are forward-stock splits, unless otherwise noted):\\n\\nAmong these top-notch stock-split stocks are two magnificent, inexpensive companies that are begging to be bought in September, as well as two highfliers that are priced for perfection and worth avoiding.\\n\\nThe first phenomenal stock-split stock you can scoop up with confidence in September is the only company of the 13 listed above that\\'s set to conduct a reverse-stock split: satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings.\\n\\nWhereas most companies completing reverse splits are doing so from a position of operating weakness, this isn\\'t the case with Sirius XM. Its roughly 3.85 billion outstanding shares have held its stock in the mid-single-digits for a decade, which might be a deterrent for some institutional investors who deem its low share price too risky. This reverse split will take place following the merger of Sirius XM with Liberty Media\\'s Sirius XM tracking stock, Liberty Sirius XM Group in a little over week, and likely make shares more attractive to big-money investors.\\n\\nWhat investors get with Sirius XM is easily identifiable competitive advantages. For example, it\\'s the only licensed satellite-radio operator in the country, which affords it substantial subscription pricing power.\\n\\nSirius XM also generates its revenue differently than terrestrial and online radio providers. Instead of relying almost exclusively on advertising, as traditional radio companies do, Sirius XM has generated 77% of its net sales from subscriptions through the first-half of 2024. People are much less likely to cancel their service during periods of economic turbulence than businesses are to pare back to marketing budgets at the first sign(s) of trouble. In other words, Sirius XM is better positioned to navigate uncertain economic climates.\\n\\nA forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 10, coupled with a dividend yield of 3.4%, makes Sirius XM stock quite the bargain for opportunistic long-term investors.\\n\\nThe other magnificent stock-split stock that\\'s begging to be bought in September is none other than Japan-based electronics goliath Sony Group. Sony\\'s American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are set to undergo a 5-for-1 split on Oct. 8.\\n\\nEven though we\\'re coming up on four years since Sony introduced the PlayStation 5, and it\\'s perfectly normal to see gaming console sales taper off late in the cycle, Sony has found a couple of ways to boost one of its top revenue channels.\\n\\nFor instance, it\\'s increasing the price of PlayStation 5 by about 19% in Japan to counter challenging economic conditions. It\\'s also seeing strong subscription sales growth from PlayStation Plus, which allows subscribers to play games with their friends and store gaming data in the cloud.\\n\\nThough it\\'s best-known for gaming, Sony Group is a diverse company. It\\'s one of the primary suppliers of image sensors used in smartphones. With telecom companies upgrading their wireless networks to support faster download speeds, consumers and businesses have been steadily trading in their old devices for new ones that are 5G-capable. The 5G revolution is providing a healthy boost to Sony\\'s Imaging and Sensing Solutions segment.\\n\\nA forward P/E of 16 is a fair (if not inexpensive) price to pay for a wonderful company that\\'ll likely be introducing a new gaming console in about two years\\' time.\\n\\nHowever, not every stock-split stock is worth buying. Even though Nvidia has been the hottest megacap stock on the planet since the start of 2023, and its H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) is the preferred choice in AI-accelerated data centers, there are too many potential red flags to ignore.\\n\\nA point I\\'ve been trying to drive home for months is that there hasn\\'t been a next-big-thing innovation, technology, or trend that\\'s escaped an early stage bubble-bursting event in 30 years. This is a nice way of saying that investors always overestimate how quickly new innovations/technologies are adopted by consumers and businesses.\\n\\nThe simple fact that most businesses lack a defined game plan for their AI data center investments strongly suggests that we\\'re witnessing the next in a long line of bubbles with AI. If and when the AI bubble bursts, I\\'d expect Nvidia\\'s stock to be clobbered.\\n\\nCompetitive pressures can also no longer be ignored. Advanced Micro Devices is ramping up production of its MI300X AI-GPU, which is substantially cheaper than the H100, and doesn\\'t face the same supply chain constraints as Nvidia\\'s chips.\\n\\nBeyond external competition, Nvidia may lose out on valuable data center space from its top customers. The four members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" that account for around 40% of Nvidia\\'s net sales are developing AI chips of their own. Even with Nvidia\\'s H100 and Blackwell chips almost certainly hanging onto their computing advantage, we\\'re witnessing a concerted effort by America\\'s most-influential businesses to reduce their reliance on Nvidia\\'s hardware.\\n\\nNvidia\\'s sequentially declining adjusted gross margin suggests we\\'ve witnessed the peak of the latest hot trend on Wall Street.\\n\\nThe other stock-split stock of the 13 that\\'s worth avoiding in September is AI-inspired enterprise analytics software company MicroStrategy.\\n\\nAlthough MicroStrategy is, technically, a software company, almost the entirety of its $27.2 billion market cap (as of this writing on Aug. 27) is derived from the Bitcoin (BTC -0.18%) it holds. As of July 31, MicroStrategy held 226,500 Bitcoins, which is more than 1% of the entire supply that\\'ll ever be mined. It also makes MicroStrategy the top corporate holder of the world\\'s largest cryptocurrency.\\n\\nThere are lot of ways to wager on Bitcoin if you\\'re a crypto optimist. However, buying MicroStrategy stock is, arguably, the worst possible way to do it. With Bitcoin trading at $59,338 per token, as of this writing, MicroStrategy\\'s Bitcoin portfolio is worth $13.44 billion. Yet, its market cap of $27.2 billion (placing a fair value estimate on the software segment of around $1 billion), implies a value of roughly $115,650 per token. Investors are paying a 95% premium for its Bitcoin assets, which makes no sense.\\n\\nAnother reason to shy away from MicroStrategy has to do with how the company is financing its Bitcoin purchases. With minimal positive operating cash flow generated from its software segment, CEO Michael Saylor has overseen a number of convertible-debt offerings to fund its acquisition of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin were to enter a steep bear market, as it\\'s done a couple of times over the last decade, MicroStrategy could struggle to meet its debt obligations.\\n\\nLastly, I\\'m not convinced that Bitcoin is in any way superior in the crypto arena. Its scarcity is based on lines of computer code that could, in theory, be altered with community consensus. Most importantly, Bitcoin\\'s payment network isn\\'t anywhere close to the fastest or the cheapest. It\\'s a first-mover network that\\'s been outdone by third-generation blockchain networks. MicroStrategy tethering its future to Bitcoin looks like a mistake I\\'d suggest avoiding.', 'source': {'uri': 'fool.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Motley Fool'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'sean_williams@fool.com', 'name': 'Sean Williams', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/788803/stock-certificate-investment-retire-heirloom-donate-capital-gains-tax-getty.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-9874292', 'sentiment': 0.4980392156862745, 'wgt': 236, 'relevance': 38}, {'uri': '2024-09-499727111', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-09-29', 'time': '09:47:54', 'dateTime': '2024-09-29T09:47:54Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-09-29T09:42:00Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9254902005195618, 'url': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/prediction-nvidia-stock-will-surge-2025-heres-why', 'title': \"Prediction: Nvidia Stock Will Surge Into 2025. Here's Why.\", 'body': \"After a blistering run since early 2023, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has hit a wall. The stock has surged 730% since the start of last year (as of this writing), but over the past three months, Nvidia has tread water, down roughly 4%.\\n\\nA number of factors have weighed on the stock. Fears regarding a potential slowdown in the adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI), rumors about a delayed release of Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell platform, concerns about a decline in the company's gross margin, and a pricey valuation have some investors fearing the stock may have gotten ahead of itself.\\n\\nHowever, a quick look at the available evidence suggests that while those concerns are understandable, they are also largely unfounded. I believe there's still plenty of room for Nvidia to run, and I predict the stock will continue to reach new all-time highs into 2025. Here's why.\\n\\nThe accelerating adoption of AI has helped fuel the run-up in technology stocks since the start of 2023, but investors have begun to wonder if that breakneck pace could continue. There's evidence that suggests it can.\\n\\nTo close out the calendar second quarter, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms all announced plans to increase capital expenditures (capex) for the remainder of 2024, while also laying out plans for significant increases next year. The vast majority of that spending will be allocated to outfitting the servers and data centers needed to support AI. Since these tech titans are Nvidia's biggest customers, this suggests the company's growth streak has legs.\\n\\nTaking a step back and looking at the big picture can also provide context. Generative AI is expected to add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy in the coming years, according to estimates provided by management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. This suggests that the adoption of AI will continue for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nBlackwell is on track\\n\\nReports emerged in early August that Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell chips would be delayed by as much as three months due to production issues. The stock skidded on these reports as investors feared the worst.\\n\\nWhen Nvidia released its quarterly results in late August, CFO Colette Kress put the matter to rest:\\n\\nWe shipped customer samples of our Blackwell architecture in the second quarter. We executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield. Blackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026. In the fourth quarter, we expect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue.\\n\\nThis suggests the reported delays were much ado about nothing.\\n\\nFears regarding slowing growth are myopic\\n\\nWhen Nvidia reported the results of its fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended July 28), there was much to like. The company generated record quarterly revenue, record quarterly data center revenue, and robust profits. However, there were two issues investors seemed to focus on in Nvidia's otherwise stellar results.\\n\\nThe first was the company's gross margin, which declined from a record 78.4% in Q1 to 75.1% in Q2. During the earnings conference call, CFO Colette Kress noted that a combination of product mix and inventory provisions related to the rollout of Blackwell were the culprits.\\n\\nThat said, the company is forecasting gross margins for the remainder of the year in the mid-70% range. While that's below the record results in the first quarter, it's still well ahead of Nvidia's 10-year average gross margin of 62%.\\n\\nData by YCharts\\n\\nThe other issue that seemed to spook some investors was Nvidia's forecast for its fiscal third quarter, which ends in late October. The company is guiding for record revenue of $32.5 billion, which would represent growth of 79%. That would mark a deceleration from the triple-digit growth Nvidia has delivered in each of the previous five quarters, but it's still a remarkable performance nonetheless.\\n\\nSavvy investors knew that the company's growth rate would eventually slow, particularly as Nvidia faces tough comps from last year. That said, the company's revenue growth is still exceptional and should be viewed in that context.\\n\\nNot as pricey as you might think\\n\\nOne of the biggest issues weighing on Nvidia is the notion that the stock is exorbitantly expensive. That view is certainly understandable, given that the stock is currently selling for 57 times earnings, compared to a price-to-earnings ratio of 30 for the S&P 500. However, investors willing to take a step back will see that Nvidia isn't as expensive as it might appear at first glance.\\n\\nA quick look at the stock chart reveals that Nvidia is actually trading slightly lower than its average P/E ratio over the past decade. It's also worth noting that during the past 10 years, Nvidia stock has gained more than 25,000%, evidence that the stock has been -- and continues to be -- deserving of a premium.\\n\\nData by YCharts\\n\\nHowever, a look ahead suggests the stock is even cheaper. Wall Street is forecasting earnings per share of $4.02 for the coming fiscal year, which kicks off in late January. That means Nvidia is currently trading for less than 29 times forward earnings (as of this writing), which is a bargain, particularly given the company's continuing growth prospects.\\n\\nAn objective view\\n\\nGiven the run-up of Nvidia stock since early last year, it's understandable that investors are taking a step back to survey the landscape. Yet it's clear the factors that have been weighing on the stock are much ado about nothing.\\n\\nNvidia's largest customers continue to spend heavily on its products, its next-generation platform is on track, its gross margin remains near a record high, and its valuation isn't nearly as pricey as it appears at first glance.\\n\\nThis all suggests a clear runway ahead for Nvidia, and I predict that the stock will continue to reach new heights well into 2025.\\n\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

The Fed Funds rate was lowered by 50 basis points, pulling most other interest rates lower with it. The Fed committee responsible for such decisions also suggests more rate cuts are in the near-term cards, which should stimulate the economy without reigniting inflation. That's why investors are celebrating the move, and the rhetoric.\\n\\nNot every company is better off with lower interest rates in this particular economic environment, however. Brokerage firm Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW) arguably has more to lose than gain for the foreseeable future. Investors would be wise to keep their expectations in check. Here's why.\\n\\nSchwab's top moneymaker is pressured, and will be for a while\\n\\nYou know Charles Schwab as a leading online broker, but trading doesn't actually drive most of its revenue. Neither does investment management or retirement plan administration. Ditto for its banking business. Rather, Schwab's single biggest source of revenue is interest income, accounting for nearly half of the company's top line. And that's after paying its own interest expenses on this revenue, to be clear.\\n\\nSurprised? Plenty of people are, given the nature of its business. Moreover, it's a cyclical problem that could persist for a while.\\n\\nCharles Schwab makes more net interest income when rates are higher than it does when they're lower, since the spreads -- the difference between interest earned and interest paid -- are higher when rates are elevated.\\n\\nWe're already seeing this phenomenon, in fact, but this pressure on profitability is also just getting started if more interest rate cuts are in store.\\n\\nThe image below tells part of the tale, comparing Schwab's interest revenue to its interest expense to determine its net interest revenue. As you can see, net interest revenue peaked in late 2022, even before interest rates themselves did. As you can also see, Schwab's net interest revenue has continued to dwindle, while overall interest rates have flattened, if not fallen themselves. Most alarming, however, is that market-based interest rates were already falling before Wednesday's decision. They're apt to continue falling too, as the Federal Reserve suggests that is in the cards.\\n\\nData source: Charles Schwab Corp. Chart by author. Dollar figures are in millions.\\n\\nHere's why it matters: As of the second quarter of this year, 46% of Schwab's total revenue is net interest revenue driven by offerings such as margin loans, cash holdings (including money market funds), and the like. That quarter's net interest revenue of $2.16 billion is almost 30% below Q2 2022's figure of over $3 billion, when this source of revenue accounted for over half of Schwab's top line.\\n\\nData source: Charles Schwab Corp. Chart by author. Figures are in millions.\\n\\nThis number is almost certainly going to get smaller going forward, as interest rates continue to fall. It's already happening, in fact. Although margin loan balances are up since then, Schwab's average level of interest earnings assets is near the first quarter's multi-year low, which is more than 16% below 2023's peak.\\n\\nImage source: Charles Schwab Corp. Q2 2024 udpate.\\n\\nIn other words, Schwab's clients are currently holding relatively few investments that generate cash flow for the broker. They're holding more stocks and bonds, which (at best) only generate one commission charge or bid/ask spread-based gain at that trade's entry.\\n\\nRight stock, wrong time\\n\\nIt's not all bad. At the very least, Schwab is winning new customers, and gathering more money as a result. As of the end of August, it was holding a stunning $9.74 trillion worth of client assets, up 20% year over year. Even if only a relatively small portion of these holdings generate recurring revenue, these holdings are still being held by the broker. It will be able to monetize them when the time is right.\\n\\nThe current economic backdrop isn't one that favors Schwab, however, or any other broker for that matter.\\n\\nEven if borrowing costs are coming down, money is still tight thanks to inflation... one of the reasons corporate bankruptcies are now above pre-pandemic levels. There's not a lot of must-have stock trading activity waiting in the wings either, with the overall economy set to be merely ho-hum for a while as the post-pandemic effects wind down. New investor money inflows are likely to slow going forward as growth stocks continue cooling off. Schwab's top and bottom lines are apt to reflect this slowdown.\\n\\nBottom line? Schwab's still a solid long-term holding. The near term doesn't look so bright, though. Less patient investors might want to consider other, more promising options in the meantime.\\n\\nShould you invest $1,000 in Charles Schwab right now?\\n\\nBefore you buy stock in Charles Schwab, consider this:\\n\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Charles Schwab wasn't one of them.

The small-cap focused Russell 2000 index, meanwhile, is up 8.5% from its lows of the month, though it has not breached its July peak.\\n\\nNext Friday\\'s non-farm payrolls report could help bolster the case for a broader market rally if it shows the labor market is cooling at a steady, though not alarming pace, said David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. Equities for UBS Global Wealth Management.\\n\\nThe jobs report \"tends to be one of the more market moving releases in general, and right now it\\'s going to get even more attention than normal.\"\\n\\nInvestors are unlikely to turn their back on tech stocks, particularly if volatility gives them a chance to buy on the cheap, said Jason Alonzo, a portfolio manager with Harbor Capital.\\n\\nTechnology stocks are expected to post above-market earnings growth over every quarter through 2025, with third-quarter earnings coming in at 15.3% compared with a 7.5% gain for the S&P 500 as a whole, according to LSEG data.\\n\\n\"People will sometimes take a deep breath after a nice run and look at other opportunities, but technology is still the clearest driver of growth, particularly the AI theme which is innocent until proven guilty,\" Alonzo said.', 'source': {'uri': 'investing.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Investing.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/trkd-images/LYNXMPEK7T0R4_M.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-9863022', 'sentiment': 0.3960784313725489, 'wgt': 238, 'relevance': 76}]\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mHere are the most important insights from the recent news articles about Charles Schwab Corporation:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Market Trends and Investor Sentiment**:\n",
      "  - A broadening rally in U.S. stocks is seen as a positive signal for investors, indicating a shift from a concentration in technology shares to value stocks and small caps.\n",
      "  - Investors are optimistic about earnings growth and profitability, especially with the Federal Reserve expected to start a rate-cutting cycle in mid-September.\n",
      "  - The market's rotation has accelerated, with a significant percentage of stocks in the S&P 500 outperforming the index recently, according to Charles Schwab data.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Charles Schwab's Position**:\n",
      "  - Liz Ann Sonders, Chief Investment Officer at Charles Schwab, noted the meaningful broadening of the market rally, which she believes has potential for further growth.\n",
      "  - Charles Schwab's data shows that 61% of stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the index in the past month, compared to only 14% over the past year.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Impact of Interest Rate Cuts**:\n",
      "  - Despite the general market optimism, Charles Schwab may not benefit as much from the expected interest rate cuts. The company's primary revenue source is net interest income, which is pressured by lower interest rates.\n",
      "  - Schwab's net interest revenue has been declining, and further rate cuts could exacerbate this trend. In Q2 2024, net interest revenue was almost 30% below the same period in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Broader Market Dynamics**:\n",
      "  - The so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" tech giants, including Nvidia, Tesla, and Microsoft, have underperformed compared to the rest of the S&P 500 since mid-July.\n",
      "  - Value stocks and small caps, such as General Electric and Targa Resources, have shown strong performance this year, with significant gains.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Economic Indicators**:\n",
      "  - Upcoming economic data, such as the non-farm payrolls report, could influence market sentiment and support the case for a broader market rally if it indicates a steady cooling of the labor market.\n",
      "  - Technology stocks are still expected to post above-market earnings growth through 2025, driven by themes like artificial intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while the broader market trends are positive and indicate a healthy diversification beyond tech stocks, Charles Schwab faces specific challenges due to its reliance on net interest income, which is likely to be impacted by the anticipated interest rate cuts.\u001b[0m\n",
