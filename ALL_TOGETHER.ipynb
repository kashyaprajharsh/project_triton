The US Commerce Department expects to bring the first EUV lithography machines online in 2025 with more sophisticated high-numerical-aperture EUV equipment coming the following year.\\n\\nOh, and if the Albany NanoTech Complex sounds familiar, that\\'s because it\\'s already the home of IBM\\'s semiconductor research fab.\\n\\nThe agencies argue the NSTC R&D center will be critical to ensuring US process leadership, reducing prototyping time, and growing the domestic semiconductor workforce. As we\\'ve previously reported, one of the biggest challenges facing US chipmaking ambitions remains a shortage of skilled workers necessary to operate the growing number of American fabs.\\n\\n\"Through this collaboration with NY Creates, Natcast and NSTC members will have access to essential lithography tools and processes to facilitate a wider range of research and accelerate commercialization of the technologies of tomorrow,\" Natcast CEO Deirdre Hanford said in a canned statement.\\n\\nThe Biden administration\\'s decision to focus on EUV isn\\'t surprising, but could be a boon for the Netherlands\\' ASML, which, as of 2024, remains the only supplier of EUV equipment.

growth outlook for the euro zone, which has flirted with recession for more than a year now.\\n\\nThe euro is headed for a fall of nearly 3% against the dollar in October, its worst monthly decline since May 2023.\\n\\nIn Asia, Chinese assets fell broadly on Wednesday, as investors braced for a tightly contested U.S. election that could have huge ramifications for China, even as Beijing tries to shore up growth.\\n\\nNews that China is considering approving the issuance of more than 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) in extra debt in the next few years was overshadowed by the prospect of hefty tariffs in the event of a victory next week by Donald Trump, especially if accompanied by a clean sweep in Congress for his Republican party.\\n\\nChina\\'s currency and equities will bear the brunt

Under the agreement, the joint venture arrangement of BTS and Terne Holdings will hold a 30% stake in The One Destination.\\n\\nThe One Destination is the developer of the Haus Da Lat project. The company is a leader in developing ESG real estate in Vietnam, actively engaged in numerous ongoing projects nationwide, and maintains a substantial land reserve. The project spans 5 hectares and has a total investment of VND 1.700 billion (~ USD 68m). It is in a prime area by the serene Xuan Huong Lake, one of Vietnam\\'s most picturesque natural lakes and a symbol of Da Lat.\\n\\nAccording to the plan, The One Destination will build Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard real estate complex on the last remaining prime land in Da Lat\\'s city center. Designed by renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, Haus Da Lat is expected to become a heritage symbol for the 130-year-old city and position Vietnam on the global ESG real estate map.\\n\\nThe decision of the international partners, to select Da Lat as their first investment destination in Vietnam highlights the city\\'s unique appeal. The partners emphasize that in a tropical country like Vietnam, Da Lat - a highland city with year-round cool weather surrounded by tranquil lakes, vast pine forests, magnificent waterfalls, and vibrant flower fields -- is a natural masterpiece. This city, often called a \"natural heritage,\" deserves real estate projects that reflect its value.\\n\\n\"We were captivated by Da Lat at first sight, and are proud to be one of the pioneering foreign investors in Da Lat\" said the representative of BTS.\\n\\nOn June 20, 2024, the Ministry of Transport issued Decision No. 758/QD-BGTVT to upgrade Lien Khuong Airport to an international airport, igniting a boom in Da Lat\\'s economy, tourism, and the entire Lam Dong province. In the first half of 2024, Lam Dong welcomed 5 million tourists, an increase of over 12%. By the end of 2024, the province is expected to receive 10 million visitors, including 550,000 international tourists. According to the 2030 plan, Lien Khuong Airport will expand to nearly 487 hectares and accommodate 5 million passengers annually, with flights from various countries worldwide.\\n\\nESG real estate is gaining traction in many developed countries and is expected to become a significant global trend in the next century. This is why the investors are partnering with The One Destination to launch a new era of ESG real estate in Vietnam, starting in Da Lat and expanding to other projects. With Vietnam\\'s dynamic economy ranking among Asia\\'s top, an average GDP growth of 6-7% annually, and a rapidly growing middle class expected to reach 40% of the population by 2030, the country\\'s real estate market is poised for a significant boom in the ESG segment. Leading companies like The One Destination will have the advantage in shaping this trend. Haus Da Lat is highly valued for its ESG-compliant design, choice of materials, construction, and operations, and focus on the human factor, aligning with the ESG goals, creating long-term value for future generations.\\n\\nCaroline Lee, Chairwoman of Terne Holdings, affirmed, \"Together with The One Destination and BTS, we will create a heritage landmark for Da Lat, Vietnam. We are proud to be among the pioneering foreign investors working alongside Vietnam\\'s real estate developers to build and preserve Da Lat in the face of the city\\'s concrete overdevelopment\".\\n\\nTerne Holdings also stated that the investment in Haus Da Lat aligns with its ongoing ESG strategy. This strategy is based on practical, measurable actions and aligns with 12 United Nations\\' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\n\\n\"The best is often saved for last, and Haus Da Lat will be Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard landmark project, a heritage for Da Lat,\" said a representative from The One Destination. Five leading international brands are also expected to join forces to create a new icon for Da Lat.\\n\\nReference Information\\n\\nThe One Destination stands at the forefront of ESG real estate development in Vietnam. We strive to address environmental challenges, minimize our ecological footprint and enhance the local environment by employing sustainable building materials and energy-efficient technologies.\\n\\nBTS Bernina Private Equity Fund is an open-end investment company whose size exceeding USD 368 million, with 60% invested in Asia.

At 22 times expected future earnings, its premium to an MSCI index of stocks of more than 40 other countries stands at its highest in more than two decades, according to LSEG Datastream.\\n\\nThough U.S. stocks have outperformed their counterparts for more than a decade, the valuation gap has widened this year thanks to resilient economic growth and strong corporate earnings - particularly for the technology sector, where excitement over developments in artificial intelligence have boosted the shares of companies such as chipmaker Nvidia.\\n\\nSome market participants believe Trump\\'s agenda of tax cuts, deregulation and even tariffs can further fuel U.S. exceptionalism, outweighing worries over their potentially disruptive nature and inflationary potential.\\n\\n\"Given the pro-growth tendencies of this new administration, I think it\\'s tough to fight the battle against U.S. equities, at least in 2025,\" said Venu Krishna, head of U.S. equity strategy at Barclays.\\n\\nSigns of a growing U.S. bias were evident immediately after the Nov. 5 election, when U.S. equity funds received more than $80 billion in the week following the vote while European and emerging market funds saw outflows, according to Deutsche Bank.\\n\\nStrategists at Morgan Stanley, UBS Global Wealth Management and the Wells Fargo Investment Institute are among those who recommend overweighting U.S. equities in portfolios or expect them to outperform next year.\\n\\nA critical driver of U.S. strength is corporate America\\'s profit edge: S&P 500 company earnings are expected to rise 9.9% this year and 14.2% in 2025, according to LSEG Datastream. Companies in Europe\\'s Stoxx 600, by contrast, are expected to increase earnings by 1.8% this year and 8.1% in 2025.\\n\\n\"The U.S. continues to be the geographic region of the world that generates the highest earnings growth and the most profitability,\" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\\n\\nThe dominant role of massive technology companies in the U.S. economy and their heavy weightings in indexes such as the S&P 500 are helping drive that growth. The five largest U.S. companies - Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com and Alphabet - have a combined market value of more than $14 trillion, compared with roughly $11 trillion for the entire STOXX 600, according to LSEG data.\\n\\nMore broadly, the U.S. economy is expected to grow by 2.8% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025, compared with 0.8% this year and 1.2% next year for a group of about 20 countries using the euro, according to forecasts from the International Monetary Fund.\\n\\nTrump\\'s plans to raise tariffs on imports could help the U.S. extend that advantage, despite the risk of some blowback, said Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners, who favors U.S. stocks.\\n\\n\"If Trump throws on a 10% to a 20% tariff on European goods, they\\'re going to get hurt more on a relative basis than we are,\" Mullaney said.\\n\\nRepublicans\\' lock on power in Washington - which could make it easier for Trump to enforce his agenda - prompted Deutsche Bank\\'s economists to raise their 2025 U.S. growth forecasts to 2.5% from 2.2%.\\n\\nWhile tax cuts and deregulation are expected to boost growth, relatively tight margins in U.S. Congress and the administration\\'s sensitivity to market reactions could limit the scope of the most \"extreme\" policies, such as tariffs, the bank wrote on Thursday.\\n\\nAnalysts at UBS Global Wealth Management, meanwhile, expect the S&P 500 to hit 6,600 next year, driven by advances in artificial intelligence, lower interest rates, tax cuts and deregulation. The index closed at 5,948.71 on Thursday.\\n\\nStill, an all-out trade war with China and other partners could hit U.S. growth and stoke inflation.

Under the agreement, the joint venture arrangement of BTS and Terne Holdings will hold a 30% stake in The One Destination.\\n\\nThe One Destination is the developer of the Haus Da Lat project. The company is a leader in developing ESG real estate in Vietnam, actively engaged in numerous ongoing projects nationwide, and maintains a substantial land reserve. The project spans 5 hectares and has a total investment of VND 1.700 billion (~ USD 68m). It is in a prime area by the serene Xuan Huong Lake, one of Vietnam\\'s most picturesque natural lakes and a symbol of Da Lat.\\n\\nAccording to the plan, The One Destination will build Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard real estate complex on the last remaining prime land in Da Lat\\'s city center. Designed by renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, Haus Da Lat is expected to become a heritage symbol for the 130-year-old city and position Vietnam on the global ESG real estate map.\\n\\nThe decision of the international partners, to select Da Lat as their first investment destination in Vietnam highlights the city\\'s unique appeal. The partners emphasize that in a tropical country like Vietnam, Da Lat - a highland city with year-round cool weather surrounded by tranquil lakes, vast pine forests, magnificent waterfalls, and vibrant flower fields -- is a natural masterpiece. This city, often called a \"natural heritage,\" deserves real estate projects that reflect its value.\\n\\n\"We were captivated by Da Lat at first sight, and are proud to be one of the pioneering foreign investors in Da Lat\" said the representative of BTS.\\n\\nOn June 20, 2024, the Ministry of Transport issued Decision No. 758/QD-BGTVT to upgrade Lien Khuong Airport to an international airport, igniting a boom in Da Lat\\'s economy, tourism, and the entire Lam Dong province. In the first half of 2024, Lam Dong welcomed 5 million tourists, an increase of over 12%. By the end of 2024, the province is expected to receive 10 million visitors, including 550,000 international tourists. According to the 2030 plan, Lien Khuong Airport will expand to nearly 487 hectares and accommodate 5 million passengers annually, with flights from various countries worldwide.\\n\\nESG real estate is gaining traction in many developed countries and is expected to become a significant global trend in the next century. This is why the investors are partnering with The One Destination to launch a new era of ESG real estate in Vietnam, starting in Da Lat and expanding to other projects. With Vietnam\\'s dynamic economy ranking among Asia\\'s top, an average GDP growth of 6-7% annually, and a rapidly growing middle class expected to reach 40% of the population by 2030, the country\\'s real estate market is poised for a significant boom in the ESG segment. Leading companies like The One Destination will have the advantage in shaping this trend. Haus Da Lat is highly valued for its ESG-compliant design, choice of materials, construction, and operations, and focus on the human factor, aligning with the ESG goals, creating long-term value for future generations.\\n\\nCaroline Lee, Chairwoman of Terne Holdings, affirmed, \"Together with The One Destination and BTS, we will create a heritage landmark for Da Lat, Vietnam. We are proud to be among the pioneering foreign investors working alongside Vietnam\\'s real estate developers to build and preserve Da Lat in the face of the city\\'s concrete overdevelopment\".\\n\\nTerne Holdings also stated that the investment in Haus Da Lat aligns with its ongoing ESG strategy. This strategy is based on practical, measurable actions and aligns with 12 United Nations\\' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\n\\n\"The best is often saved for last, and Haus Da Lat will be Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard landmark project, a heritage for Da Lat,\" said a representative from The One Destination. Five leading international brands are also expected to join forces to create a new icon for Da Lat.\\n\\nReference Information\\n\\nThe One Destination stands at the forefront of ESG real estate development in Vietnam. We strive to address environmental challenges, minimize our ecological footprint and enhance the local environment by employing sustainable building materials and energy-efficient technologies.\\n\\nBTS Bernina Private Equity Fund is an open-end investment company whose size exceeding USD 368 million, with 60% invested in Asia.

At 22 times expected future earnings, its premium to an MSCI index of stocks of more than 40 other countries stands at its highest in more than two decades, according to LSEG Datastream.\\n\\nThough U.S. stocks have outperformed their counterparts for more than a decade, the valuation gap has widened this year thanks to resilient economic growth and strong corporate earnings - particularly for the technology sector, where excitement over developments in artificial intelligence have boosted the shares of companies such as chipmaker Nvidia.\\n\\nSome market participants believe Trump\\'s agenda of tax cuts, deregulation and even tariffs can further fuel U.S. exceptionalism, outweighing worries over their potentially disruptive nature and inflationary potential.\\n\\n\"Given the pro-growth tendencies of this new administration, I think it\\'s tough to fight the battle against U.S. equities, at least in 2025,\" said Venu Krishna, head of U.S. equity strategy at Barclays.\\n\\nSigns of a growing U.S. bias were evident immediately after the Nov. 5 election, when U.S. equity funds received more than $80 billion in the week following the vote while European and emerging market funds saw outflows, according to Deutsche Bank.\\n\\nStrategists at Morgan Stanley, UBS Global Wealth Management and the Wells Fargo Investment Institute are among those who recommend overweighting U.S. equities in portfolios or expect them to outperform next year.\\n\\nA critical driver of U.S. strength is corporate America\\'s profit edge: S&P 500 company earnings are expected to rise 9.9% this year and 14.2% in 2025, according to LSEG Datastream. Companies in Europe\\'s Stoxx 600, by contrast, are expected to increase earnings by 1.8% this year and 8.1% in 2025.\\n\\n\"The U.S. continues to be the geographic region of the world that generates the highest earnings growth and the most profitability,\" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\\n\\nThe dominant role of massive technology companies in the U.S. economy and their heavy weightings in indexes such as the S&P 500 are helping drive that growth. The five largest U.S. companies - Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com and Alphabet - have a combined market value of more than $14 trillion, compared with roughly $11 trillion for the entire STOXX 600, according to LSEG data.\\n\\nMore broadly, the U.S. economy is expected to grow by 2.8% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025, compared with 0.8% this year and 1.2% next year for a group of about 20 countries using the euro, according to forecasts from the International Monetary Fund.\\n\\nTrump\\'s plans to raise tariffs on imports could help the U.S. extend that advantage, despite the risk of some blowback, said Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners, who favors U.S. stocks.\\n\\n\"If Trump throws on a 10% to a 20% tariff on European goods, they\\'re going to get hurt more on a relative basis than we are,\" Mullaney said.\\n\\nRepublicans\\' lock on power in Washington - which could make it easier for Trump to enforce his agenda - prompted Deutsche Bank\\'s economists to raise their 2025 U.S. growth forecasts to 2.5% from 2.2%.\\n\\nWhile tax cuts and deregulation are expected to boost growth, relatively tight margins in U.S. Congress and the administration\\'s sensitivity to market reactions could limit the scope of the most \"extreme\" policies, such as tariffs, the bank wrote on Thursday.\\n\\nAnalysts at UBS Global Wealth Management, meanwhile, expect the S&P 500 to hit 6,600 next year, driven by advances in artificial intelligence, lower interest rates, tax cuts and deregulation. The index closed at 5,948.71 on Thursday.\\n\\nStill, an all-out trade war with China and other partners could hit U.S. growth and stoke inflation. A scenario in which countries retaliate against far-reaching U.S tariffs could send the S&P 500 to as low 5,100 - though global stocks would also decline, UBS said.\\n\\nCertain corners of the market could be particularly vulnerable to Trump\\'s policies: worries over plans for cutting bureaucratic excess bruised shares of government contractors last week, for example, while drugmakers fell when Trump picked vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\\n\\nBroad tax cuts could also spark concerns about adding to U.S. debt. Deficit worries have helped drive a recent selloff in U.S. government bonds, taking the 10-year Treasury yield to a five-month high last week.\\n\\nAt the same time, the valuation gap between the U.S. and the rest of the world could become so wide that U.S. stocks start looking expensive, or international equities become too cheap to ignore.\\n\\nFor now, however, the long-term trend is in favor of the U.S., with the S&P 500 gaining more than 180% against a rise of nearly 50% for Europe\\'s STOXX over the past decade. \"Momentum is a great thing,\" said Colin Graham, head of multi-asset strategies at Robeco. \"If you\\'ve got something that keeps outperforming, then investors will follow the money.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'theglobeandmail.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Globe and Mail'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/55R45Z2FXJH25E3ZRYNXCF6DAI.jpg?auth=3dcd34c09efc17697808a399cce618cf98dd18f1a1f24021b610552e0f0c6600&width=560&quality=80', 'eventUri': 'eng-10108049', 'sentiment': -0.07450980392156858, 'wgt': 249, 'relevance': 51}, {'uri': '8424627140', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-11-22', 'time': '22:05:38', 'dateTime': '2024-11-22T22:05:38Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-11-22T22:04:56Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9764705896377563, 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com/news/world/coreweave-targets-valuation-of-over-35-billion-in-2025-us-ipo-sources-say-11732312872937.html', 'title': 'CoreWeave targets valuation of over $35 billion in 2025 US IPO, sources say', 'body': \"NEW YORK, - Artificial intelligence cloud platform CoreWeave, is aiming for a valuation of more than $35 billion in its U.S. initial public offering that is expected to occur next year, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.\\n\\nRoseland, New Jersey-based CoreWeave is likely to target raising more than $3 billion from its share sale, which could launch during the second quarter of 2025, the sources said, cautioning that the company's plans are subject to market conditions and could change.\\n\\nThe discussions come at a time when investor interest in generative AI is sky-rocketing.

The order sought to limit the access that \"countries of concern\\'\\' -- specifically, China, Hong Kong and Macau -- have to American dollars to fund technologies that could be used, for example, to break codes or develop next-generation fighter jets. It will take effect Jan. 2.\\n\\n\"U.S. investments ... must not be used to help countries of concern develop their military, intelligence and cyber capabilities\\'\\'\\' said Paul Rosen, assistant Treasury secretary for investment security. He noted the investments can mean more than just money; they can deliver \"intangible benefits,\\'\\' including managerial help and assistance finding top talent and tapping other sources of financing.\\n\\nBlocking China\\'s high-tech ambitions is one of the few issues that enjoys broad support in Washington from both Republicans and Democrats.\\n\\nBiden in May slapped a stiff tariff on electric vehicles from China. He also has imposed export controls to keep the Chinese from acquiring advanced computer chips and the equipment to produce them. Former President Donald Trump has vowed to dramatically increase taxes on all imports from China if voters send him back to the White House.\\n\\nThe Biden administration sought comment from businesses and from U.S. allies before putting out the final version.\\n\\nIn addition to blocking investments, the rule requires Americans and companies in the United States to notify the U.S. government of transactions that involve \"technologies and products that may contribute to a threat to the national security of the United States.\\'\\'\\n\\nViolators can be hit with fines of up to $368,136 or twice the value of the prohibited transaction, whichever is greater. Treasury is setting up an Office of Global Transactions to oversee the new rule.\\n\\nIn his weekly briefing on Tuesday, Hong Kong leader John Lee said the restrictions once again reflected some U.S. politicians were undermining normal investment and trade for their political interests, and these acts would cause harm to the global supply chain. Lee said the U.S. has enjoyed a trade surplus of $472 billion with Hong Kong in the past 10 years.\\n\\n\"In pursuing their political agenda, American politicians are harming not only others but also the interests of their own country, their people and their businesses. They will have to face the consequences of their actions,\" he said.', 'source': {'uri': 'ca.finance.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo!

He also has imposed export controls to keep the Chinese from acquiring advanced computer chips and the equipment to produce them. Former President Donald Trump has vowed to dramatically increase taxes on all imports from China if voters send him back to the White House.\\n\\nThe Biden administration sought comment from businesses and from U.S. allies before putting out the final version.\\n\\nIn addition to blocking investments, the rule requires Americans and companies in the United States to notify the U.S. government of transactions that involve \"technologies and products that may contribute to a threat to the national security of the United States.\\'\\'\\n\\nViolators can be hit with fines of up to $368,136 or twice the value of the prohibited transaction, whichever is greater.

Under the agreement, the joint venture arrangement of BTS and Terne Holdings will hold a 30% stake in The One Destination.\\n\\nThe One Destination is the developer of the Haus Da Lat project. The company is a leader in developing ESG real estate in Vietnam, actively engaged in numerous ongoing projects nationwide, and maintains a substantial land reserve. The project spans 5 hectares and has a total investment of VND 1.700 billion (~ USD 68m). It is in a prime area by the serene Xuan Huong Lake, one of Vietnam\\'s most picturesque natural lakes and a symbol of Da Lat.\\n\\nAccording to the plan, The One Destination will build Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard real estate complex on the last remaining prime land in Da Lat\\'s city center. Designed by renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, Haus Da Lat is expected to become a heritage symbol for the 130-year-old city and position Vietnam on the global ESG real estate map.\\n\\nThe decision of the international partners, to select Da Lat as their first investment destination in Vietnam highlights the city\\'s unique appeal. The partners emphasize that in a tropical country like Vietnam, Da Lat - a highland city with year-round cool weather surrounded by tranquil lakes, vast pine forests, magnificent waterfalls, and vibrant flower fields -- is a natural masterpiece. This city, often called a \"natural heritage,\" deserves real estate projects that reflect its value.\\n\\n\"We were captivated by Da Lat at first sight, and are proud to be one of the pioneering foreign investors in Da Lat\" said the representative of BTS.\\n\\nOn June 20, 2024, the Ministry of Transport issued Decision No. 758/QD-BGTVT to upgrade Lien Khuong Airport to an international airport, igniting a boom in Da Lat\\'s economy, tourism, and the entire Lam Dong province. In the first half of 2024, Lam Dong welcomed 5 million tourists, an increase of over 12%. By the end of 2024, the province is expected to receive 10 million visitors, including 550,000 international tourists. According to the 2030 plan, Lien Khuong Airport will expand to nearly 487 hectares and accommodate 5 million passengers annually, with flights from various countries worldwide.\\n\\nESG real estate is gaining traction in many developed countries and is expected to become a significant global trend in the next century. This is why the investors are partnering with The One Destination to launch a new era of ESG real estate in Vietnam, starting in Da Lat and expanding to other projects. With Vietnam\\'s dynamic economy ranking among Asia\\'s top, an average GDP growth of 6-7% annually, and a rapidly growing middle class expected to reach 40% of the population by 2030, the country\\'s real estate market is poised for a significant boom in the ESG segment. Leading companies like The One Destination will have the advantage in shaping this trend. Haus Da Lat is highly valued for its ESG-compliant design, choice of materials, construction, and operations, and focus on the human factor, aligning with the ESG goals, creating long-term value for future generations.\\n\\nCaroline Lee, Chairwoman of Terne Holdings, affirmed, \"Together with The One Destination and BTS, we will create a heritage landmark for Da Lat, Vietnam. We are proud to be among the pioneering foreign investors working alongside Vietnam\\'s real estate developers to build and preserve Da Lat in the face of the city\\'s concrete overdevelopment\".\\n\\nTerne Holdings also stated that the investment in Haus Da Lat aligns with its ongoing ESG strategy. This strategy is based on practical, measurable actions and aligns with 12 United Nations\\' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\n\\n\"The best is often saved for last, and Haus Da Lat will be Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard landmark project, a heritage for Da Lat,\" said a representative from The One Destination. Five leading international brands are also expected to join forces to create a new icon for Da Lat.\\n\\nReference Information\\n\\nThe One Destination stands at the forefront of ESG real estate development in Vietnam.

At 22 times expected future earnings, its premium to an MSCI index of stocks of more than 40 other countries stands at its highest in more than two decades, according to LSEG Datastream.\\n\\nThough U.S. stocks have outperformed their counterparts for more than a decade, the valuation gap has widened this year thanks to resilient economic growth and strong corporate earnings - particularly for the technology sector, where excitement over developments in artificial intelligence have boosted the shares of companies such as chipmaker Nvidia.\\n\\nSome market participants believe Trump\\'s agenda of tax cuts, deregulation and even tariffs can further fuel U.S. exceptionalism, outweighing worries over their potentially disruptive nature and inflationary potential.\\n\\n\"Given the pro-growth tendencies of this new administration, I think it\\'s tough to fight the battle against U.S. equities, at least in 2025,\" said Venu Krishna, head of U.S. equity strategy at Barclays.\\n\\nSigns of a growing U.S. bias were evident immediately after the Nov. 5 election, when U.S. equity funds received more than $80 billion in the week following the vote while European and emerging market funds saw outflows, according to Deutsche Bank.\\n\\nStrategists at Morgan Stanley, UBS Global Wealth Management and the Wells Fargo Investment Institute are among those who recommend overweighting U.S. equities in portfolios or expect them to outperform next year.\\n\\nA critical driver of U.S. strength is corporate America\\'s profit edge: S&P 500 company earnings are expected to rise 9.9% this year and 14.2% in 2025, according to LSEG Datastream. Companies in Europe\\'s Stoxx 600, by contrast, are expected to increase earnings by 1.8% this year and 8.1% in 2025.\\n\\n\"The U.S. continues to be the geographic region of the world that generates the highest earnings growth and the most profitability,\" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\\n\\nThe dominant role of massive technology companies in the U.S. economy and their heavy weightings in indexes such as the S&P 500 are helping drive that growth. The five largest U.S. companies - Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com and Alphabet - have a combined market value of more than $14 trillion, compared with roughly $11 trillion for the entire STOXX 600, according to LSEG data.\\n\\nMore broadly, the U.S. economy is expected to grow by 2.8% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025, compared with 0.8% this year and 1.2% next year for a group of about 20 countries using the euro, according to forecasts from the International Monetary Fund.\\n\\nTrump\\'s plans to raise tariffs on imports could help the U.S. extend that advantage, despite the risk of some blowback, said Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners, who favors U.S. stocks.\\n\\n\"If Trump throws on a 10% to a 20% tariff on European goods, they\\'re going to get hurt more on a relative basis than we are,\" Mullaney said.\\n\\nRepublicans\\' lock on power in Washington - which could make it easier for Trump to enforce his agenda - prompted Deutsche Bank\\'s economists to raise their 2025 U.S. growth forecasts to 2.5% from 2.2%.\\n\\nWhile tax cuts and deregulation are expected to boost growth, relatively tight margins in U.S. Congress and the administration\\'s sensitivity to market reactions could limit the scope of the most \"extreme\" policies, such as tariffs, the bank wrote on Thursday.\\n\\nAnalysts at UBS Global Wealth Management, meanwhile, expect the S&P 500 to hit 6,600 next year, driven by advances in artificial intelligence, lower interest rates, tax cuts and deregulation. The index closed at 5,948.71 on Thursday.\\n\\nStill, an all-out trade war with China and other partners could hit U.S. growth and stoke inflation. A scenario in which countries retaliate against far-reaching U.S tariffs could send the S&P 500 to as low 5,100 - though global stocks would also decline, UBS said.\\n\\nCertain corners of the market could be particularly vulnerable to Trump\\'s policies: worries over plans for cutting bureaucratic excess bruised shares of government contractors last week, for example, while drugmakers fell when Trump picked vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\\n\\nBroad tax cuts could also spark concerns about adding to U.S. debt. Deficit worries have helped drive a recent selloff in U.S. government bonds, taking the 10-year Treasury yield to a five-month high last week.\\n\\nAt the same time, the valuation gap between the U.S. and the rest of the world could become so wide that U.S. stocks start looking expensive, or international equities become too cheap to ignore.\\n\\nFor now, however, the long-term trend is in favor of the U.S., with the S&P 500 gaining more than 180% against a rise of nearly 50% for Europe\\'s STOXX over the past decade. \"Momentum is a great thing,\" said Colin Graham, head of multi-asset strategies at Robeco. \"If you\\'ve got something that keeps outperforming, then investors will follow the money.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'theglobeandmail.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Globe and Mail'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/55R45Z2FXJH25E3ZRYNXCF6DAI.jpg?auth=3dcd34c09efc17697808a399cce618cf98dd18f1a1f24021b610552e0f0c6600&width=560&quality=80', 'eventUri': 'eng-10108049', 'sentiment': -0.07450980392156858, 'wgt': 249, 'relevance': 51}, {'uri': '8424627140', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-11-22', 'time': '22:05:38', 'dateTime': '2024-11-22T22:05:38Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-11-22T22:04:56Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9764705896377563, 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com/news/world/coreweave-targets-valuation-of-over-35-billion-in-2025-us-ipo-sources-say-11732312872937.html', 'title': 'CoreWeave targets valuation of over $35 billion in 2025 US IPO, sources say', 'body': \"NEW YORK, - Artificial intelligence cloud platform CoreWeave, is aiming for a valuation of more than $35 billion in its U.S. initial public offering that is expected to occur next year, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.\\n\\nRoseland, New Jersey-based CoreWeave is likely to target raising more than $3 billion from its share sale, which could launch during the second quarter of 2025, the sources said, cautioning that the company's plans are subject to market conditions and could change.\\n\\nThe discussions come at a time when investor interest in generative AI is sky-rocketing.

The order sought to limit the access that \"countries of concern\\'\\' -- specifically, China, Hong Kong and Macau -- have to American dollars to fund technologies that could be used, for example, to break codes or develop next-generation fighter jets. It will take effect Jan. 2.\\n\\n\"U.S. investments ... must not be used to help countries of concern develop their military, intelligence and cyber capabilities\\'\\'\\' said Paul Rosen, assistant Treasury secretary for investment security.

the world\\'s largest economy maintained a solid pace of growth, as subsiding inflation and strong wage gains powered consumer spending.\\n\\nThat is likely to contrast with the increasingly dour growth outlook for the euro zone, which has flirted with recession for more than a year now.\\n\\nThe euro is headed for a fall of nearly 3% against the dollar in October, its worst monthly decline since May 2023.\\n\\nIn Asia, Chinese assets fell broadly on Wednesday, as investors braced for a tightly contested U.S. election that could have huge ramifications for China, even as Beijing tries to shore up growth.\\n\\nNews that China is considering approving the issuance of more than 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) in extra debt in the next few years was overshadowed by the prospect of hefty

Under the agreement, the joint venture arrangement of BTS and Terne Holdings will hold a 30% stake in The One Destination.\\n\\nThe One Destination is the developer of the Haus Da Lat project. The company is a leader in developing ESG real estate in Vietnam, actively engaged in numerous ongoing projects nationwide, and maintains a substantial land reserve. The project spans 5 hectares and has a total investment of VND 1.700 billion (~ USD 68m). It is in a prime area by the serene Xuan Huong Lake, one of Vietnam\\'s most picturesque natural lakes and a symbol of Da Lat.\\n\\nAccording to the plan, The One Destination will build Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard real estate complex on the last remaining prime land in Da Lat\\'s city center. Designed by renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, Haus Da Lat is expected to become a heritage symbol for the 130-year-old city and position Vietnam on the global ESG real estate map.\\n\\nThe decision of the international partners, to select Da Lat as their first investment destination in Vietnam highlights the city\\'s unique appeal. The partners emphasize that in a tropical country like Vietnam, Da Lat - a highland city with year-round cool weather surrounded by tranquil lakes, vast pine forests, magnificent waterfalls, and vibrant flower fields -- is a natural masterpiece. This city, often called a \"natural heritage,\" deserves real estate projects that reflect its value.\\n\\n\"We were captivated by Da Lat at first sight, and are proud to be one of the pioneering foreign investors in Da Lat\" said the representative of BTS.\\n\\nOn June 20, 2024, the Ministry of Transport issued Decision No. 758/QD-BGTVT to upgrade Lien Khuong Airport to an international airport, igniting a boom in Da Lat\\'s economy, tourism, and the entire Lam Dong province. In the first half of 2024, Lam Dong welcomed 5 million tourists, an increase of over 12%. By the end of 2024, the province is expected to receive 10 million visitors, including 550,000 international tourists. According to the 2030 plan, Lien Khuong Airport will expand to nearly 487 hectares and accommodate 5 million passengers annually, with flights from various countries worldwide.\\n\\nESG real estate is gaining traction in many developed countries and is expected to become a significant global trend in the next century. This is why the investors are partnering with The One Destination to launch a new era of ESG real estate in Vietnam, starting in Da Lat and expanding to other projects. With Vietnam\\'s dynamic economy ranking among Asia\\'s top, an average GDP growth of 6-7% annually, and a rapidly growing middle class expected to reach 40% of the population by 2030, the country\\'s real estate market is poised for a significant boom in the ESG segment. Leading companies like The One Destination will have the advantage in shaping this trend. Haus Da Lat is highly valued for its ESG-compliant design, choice of materials, construction, and operations, and focus on the human factor, aligning with the ESG goals, creating long-term value for future generations.\\n\\nCaroline Lee, Chairwoman of Terne Holdings, affirmed, \"Together with The One Destination and BTS, we will create a heritage landmark for Da Lat, Vietnam. We are proud to be among the pioneering foreign investors working alongside Vietnam\\'s real estate developers to build and preserve Da Lat in the face of the city\\'s concrete overdevelopment\".\\n\\nTerne Holdings also stated that the investment in Haus Da Lat aligns with its ongoing ESG strategy. This strategy is based on practical, measurable actions and aligns with 12 United Nations\\' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\n\\n\"The best is often saved for last, and Haus Da Lat will be Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard landmark project, a heritage for Da Lat,\" said a representative from The One Destination. Five leading international brands are also expected to join forces to create a new icon for Da Lat.\\n\\nReference Information\\n\\nThe One Destination stands at the forefront of ESG real estate development in Vietnam. We strive to address environmental challenges, minimize our ecological footprint and enhance the local environment by employing sustainable building materials and energy-efficient technologies.\\n\\nBTS Bernina Private Equity Fund is an open-end investment company whose size exceeding USD 368 million, with 60% invested in Asia.

At 22 times expected future earnings, its premium to an MSCI index of stocks of more than 40 other countries stands at its highest in more than two decades, according to LSEG Datastream.\\n\\nThough U.S. stocks have outperformed their counterparts for more than a decade, the valuation gap has widened this year thanks to resilient economic growth and strong corporate earnings - particularly for the technology sector, where excitement over developments in artificial intelligence have boosted the shares of companies such as chipmaker Nvidia.\\n\\nSome market participants believe Trump\\'s agenda of tax cuts, deregulation and even tariffs can further fuel U.S. exceptionalism, outweighing worries over their potentially disruptive nature and inflationary potential.\\n\\n\"Given the pro-growth tendencies of this new administration, I think it\\'s tough to fight the battle against U.S. equities, at least in 2025,\" said Venu Krishna, head of U.S. equity strategy at Barclays.\\n\\nSigns of a growing U.S. bias were evident immediately after the Nov. 5 election, when U.S. equity funds received more than $80 billion in the week following the vote while European and emerging market funds saw outflows, according to Deutsche Bank.\\n\\nStrategists at Morgan Stanley, UBS Global Wealth Management and the Wells Fargo Investment Institute are among those who recommend overweighting U.S. equities in portfolios or expect them to outperform next year.\\n\\nA critical driver of U.S. strength is corporate America\\'s profit edge: S&P 500 company earnings are expected to rise 9.9% this year and 14.2% in 2025, according to LSEG Datastream. Companies in Europe\\'s Stoxx 600, by contrast, are expected to increase earnings by 1.8% this year and 8.1% in 2025.\\n\\n\"The U.S. continues to be the geographic region of the world that generates the highest earnings growth and the most profitability,\" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\\n\\nThe dominant role of massive technology companies in the U.S. economy and their heavy weightings in indexes such as the S&P 500 are helping drive that growth. The five largest U.S. companies - Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com and Alphabet - have a combined market value of more than $14 trillion, compared with roughly $11 trillion for the entire STOXX 600, according to LSEG data.\\n\\nMore broadly, the U.S. economy is expected to grow by 2.8% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025, compared with 0.8% this year and 1.2% next year for a group of about 20 countries using the euro, according to forecasts from the International Monetary Fund.\\n\\nTrump\\'s plans to raise tariffs on imports could help the U.S. extend that advantage, despite the risk of some blowback, said Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners, who favors U.S. stocks.\\n\\n\"If Trump throws on a 10% to a 20% tariff on European goods, they\\'re going to get hurt more on a relative basis than we are,\" Mullaney said.\\n\\nRepublicans\\' lock on power in Washington - which could make it easier for Trump to enforce his agenda - prompted Deutsche Bank\\'s economists to raise their 2025 U.S. growth forecasts to 2.5% from 2.2%.\\n\\nWhile tax cuts and deregulation are expected to boost growth, relatively tight margins in U.S. Congress and the administration\\'s sensitivity to market reactions could limit the scope of the most \"extreme\" policies, such as tariffs, the bank wrote on Thursday.\\n\\nAnalysts at UBS Global Wealth Management, meanwhile, expect the S&P 500 to hit 6,600 next year, driven by advances in artificial intelligence, lower interest rates, tax cuts and deregulation. The index closed at 5,948.71 on Thursday.\\n\\nStill, an all-out trade war with China and other partners could hit U.S. growth and stoke inflation. A scenario in which countries retaliate against far-reaching U.S tariffs could send the S&P 500 to as low 5,100 - though global stocks would also decline, UBS said.\\n\\nCertain corners of the market could be particularly vulnerable to Trump\\'s policies: worries over plans for cutting bureaucratic excess bruised shares of government contractors last week, for example, while drugmakers fell when Trump picked vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\\n\\nBroad tax cuts could also spark concerns about adding to U.S. debt. Deficit worries have helped drive a recent selloff in U.S. government bonds, taking the 10-year Treasury yield to a five-month high last week.\\n\\nAt the same time, the valuation gap between the U.S. and the rest of the world could become so wide that U.S. stocks start looking expensive, or international equities become too cheap to ignore.\\n\\nFor now, however, the long-term trend is in favor of the U.S., with the S&P 500 gaining more than 180% against a rise of nearly 50% for Europe\\'s STOXX over the past decade. \"Momentum is a great thing,\" said Colin Graham, head of multi-asset strategies at Robeco. \"If you\\'ve got something that keeps outperforming, then investors will follow the money.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'theglobeandmail.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Globe and Mail'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/55R45Z2FXJH25E3ZRYNXCF6DAI.jpg?auth=3dcd34c09efc17697808a399cce618cf98dd18f1a1f24021b610552e0f0c6600&width=560&quality=80', 'eventUri': 'eng-10108049', 'sentiment': -0.07450980392156858, 'wgt': 249, 'relevance': 51}, {'uri': '8424627140', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-11-22', 'time': '22:05:38', 'dateTime': '2024-11-22T22:05:38Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-11-22T22:04:56Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9764705896377563, 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com/news/world/coreweave-targets-valuation-of-over-35-billion-in-2025-us-ipo-sources-say-11732312872937.html', 'title': 'CoreWeave targets valuation of over $35 billion in 2025 US IPO, sources say', 'body': \"NEW YORK, - Artificial intelligence cloud platform CoreWeave, is aiming for a valuation of more than $35 billion in its U.S. initial public offering that is expected to occur next year, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.\\n\\nRoseland, New Jersey-based CoreWeave is likely to target raising more than $3 billion from its share sale, which could launch during the second quarter of 2025, the sources said, cautioning that the company's plans are subject to market conditions and could change.\\n\\nThe discussions come at a time when investor interest in generative AI is sky-rocketing.

Under the agreement, the joint venture arrangement of BTS and Terne Holdings will hold a 30% stake in The One Destination.\\n\\nThe One Destination is the developer of the Haus Da Lat project. The company is a leader in developing ESG real estate in Vietnam, actively engaged in numerous ongoing projects nationwide, and maintains a substantial land reserve. The project spans 5 hectares and has a total investment of VND 1.700 billion (~ USD 68m). It is in a prime area by the serene Xuan Huong Lake, one of Vietnam\\'s most picturesque natural lakes and a symbol of Da Lat.\\n\\nAccording to the plan, The One Destination will build Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard real estate complex on the last remaining prime land in Da Lat\\'s city center. Designed by renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, Haus Da Lat is expected to become a heritage symbol for the 130-year-old city and position Vietnam on the global ESG real estate map.\\n\\nThe decision of the international partners, to select Da Lat as their first investment destination in Vietnam highlights the city\\'s unique appeal. The partners emphasize that in a tropical country like Vietnam, Da Lat - a highland city with year-round cool weather surrounded by tranquil lakes, vast pine forests, magnificent waterfalls, and vibrant flower fields -- is a natural masterpiece. This city, often called a \"natural heritage,\" deserves real estate projects that reflect its value.\\n\\n\"We were captivated by Da Lat at first sight, and are proud to be one of the pioneering foreign investors in Da Lat\" said the representative of BTS.\\n\\nOn June 20, 2024, the Ministry of Transport issued Decision No. 758/QD-BGTVT to upgrade Lien Khuong Airport to an international airport, igniting a boom in Da Lat\\'s economy, tourism, and the entire Lam Dong province. In the first half of 2024, Lam Dong welcomed 5 million tourists, an increase of over 12%. By the end of 2024, the province is expected to receive 10 million visitors, including 550,000 international tourists. According to the 2030 plan, Lien Khuong Airport will expand to nearly 487 hectares and accommodate 5 million passengers annually, with flights from various countries worldwide.\\n\\nESG real estate is gaining traction in many developed countries and is expected to become a significant global trend in the next century. This is why the investors are partnering with The One Destination to launch a new era of ESG real estate in Vietnam, starting in Da Lat and expanding to other projects. With Vietnam\\'s dynamic economy ranking among Asia\\'s top, an average GDP growth of 6-7% annually, and a rapidly growing middle class expected to reach 40% of the population by 2030, the country\\'s real estate market is poised for a significant boom in the ESG segment. Leading companies like The One Destination will have the advantage in shaping this trend. Haus Da Lat is highly valued for its ESG-compliant design, choice of materials, construction, and operations, and focus on the human factor, aligning with the ESG goals, creating long-term value for future generations.\\n\\nCaroline Lee, Chairwoman of Terne Holdings, affirmed, \"Together with The One Destination and BTS, we will create a heritage landmark for Da Lat, Vietnam. We are proud to be among the pioneering foreign investors working alongside Vietnam\\'s real estate developers to build and preserve Da Lat in the face of the city\\'s concrete overdevelopment\".\\n\\nTerne Holdings also stated that the investment in Haus Da Lat aligns with its ongoing ESG strategy. This strategy is based on practical, measurable actions and aligns with 12 United Nations\\' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\n\\n\"The best is often saved for last, and Haus Da Lat will be Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard landmark project, a heritage for Da Lat,\" said a representative from The One Destination. Five leading international brands are also expected to join forces to create a new icon for Da Lat.\\n\\nReference Information\\n\\nThe One Destination stands at the forefront of ESG real estate development in Vietnam. We strive to address environmental challenges, minimize our ecological footprint and enhance the local environment by employing sustainable building materials and energy-efficient technologies.\\n\\nBTS Bernina Private Equity Fund is an open-end investment company whose size exceeding USD 368 million, with 60% invested in Asia. Over the past three years, the fund\\'s performance has reached 71.9%.\\n\\nTerne Holdings is a multi-sector investment enterprise based in Singapore focuses on investments in creating ecological spaces that preserve the beauty of nature, prioritize health, and build strong communities.\\n\\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-one-destination-together-with-a-singapore-investor-and-an-institutional-fund-collaborate-to-build-vietnams-first-esg-real-estate-complex-in-da-lat-302299732.html', 'source': {'uri': 'streetinsider.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'StreetInsider.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png', 'eventUri': 'eng-10072106', 'sentiment': 0.3568627450980393, 'wgt': 251, 'relevance': 56}, {'uri': '2024-11-532410294', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-11-01', 'time': '03:04:36', 'dateTime': '2024-11-01T03:04:36Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-10-31T22:12:00Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9843137264251709, 'url': 'https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2024-10-31/asia-markets-start-momentous-month-on-cautious-side-us-payrolls-awaited', 'title': 'Asia Markets Start Momentous Month on Cautious Side, US Payrolls Awaited', 'body': 'SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian markets started a likely momentous month on the cautious side, with shares mostly lower and Treasury yields near three-month highs on Friday, while investors wait for U.S. payrolls data, although a rate cut next week is largely baked in.\\n\\nInvestors are awaiting Friday\\'s nonfarm payrolls report, ahead of Tuesday\\'s U.S. presidential election and Federal Reserve\\'s policy meeting a day later.\\n\\nOil extended its rally, with Brent prices up almost 2% to $74.13 a barrel, on reports that Iran was preparing a retaliatory strike on Israel from Iraqi territory in the coming days.

At 22 times expected future earnings, its premium to an MSCI index of stocks of more than 40 other countries stands at its highest in more than two decades, according to LSEG Datastream.\\n\\nThough U.S. stocks have outperformed their counterparts for more than a decade, the valuation gap has widened this year thanks to resilient economic growth and strong corporate earnings - particularly for the technology sector, where excitement over developments in artificial intelligence have boosted the shares of companies such as chipmaker Nvidia.\\n\\nSome market participants believe Trump\\'s agenda of tax cuts, deregulation and even tariffs can further fuel U.S. exceptionalism, outweighing worries over their potentially disruptive nature and inflationary potential.\\n\\n\"Given the pro-growth tendencies of this new administration, I think it\\'s tough to fight the battle against U.S. equities, at least in 2025,\" said Venu Krishna, head of U.S. equity strategy at Barclays.\\n\\nSigns of a growing U.S. bias were evident immediately after the Nov. 5 election, when U.S. equity funds received more than $80 billion in the week following the vote while European and emerging market funds saw outflows, according to Deutsche Bank.\\n\\nStrategists at Morgan Stanley, UBS Global Wealth Management and the Wells Fargo Investment Institute are among those who recommend overweighting U.S. equities in portfolios or expect them to outperform next year.\\n\\nA critical driver of U.S. strength is corporate America\\'s profit edge: S&P 500 company earnings are expected to rise 9.9% this year and 14.2% in 2025, according to LSEG Datastream. Companies in Europe\\'s Stoxx 600, by contrast, are expected to increase earnings by 1.8% this year and 8.1% in 2025.\\n\\n\"The U.S. continues to be the geographic region of the world that generates the highest earnings growth and the most profitability,\" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\\n\\nThe dominant role of massive technology companies in the U.S. economy and their heavy weightings in indexes such as the S&P 500 are helping drive that growth. The five largest U.S. companies - Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com and Alphabet - have a combined market value of more than $14 trillion, compared with roughly $11 trillion for the entire STOXX 600, according to LSEG data.\\n\\nMore broadly, the U.S. economy is expected to grow by 2.8% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025, compared with 0.8% this year and 1.2% next year for a group of about 20 countries using the euro, according to forecasts from the International Monetary Fund.\\n\\nTrump\\'s plans to raise tariffs on imports could help the U.S. extend that advantage, despite the risk of some blowback, said Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners, who favors U.S. stocks.\\n\\n\"If Trump throws on a 10% to a 20% tariff on European goods, they\\'re going to get hurt more on a relative basis than we are,\" Mullaney said.\\n\\nRepublicans\\' lock on power in Washington - which could make it easier for Trump to enforce his agenda - prompted Deutsche Bank\\'s economists to raise their 2025 U.S. growth forecasts to 2.5% from 2.2%.\\n\\nWhile tax cuts and deregulation are expected to boost growth, relatively tight margins in U.S. Congress and the administration\\'s sensitivity to market reactions could limit the scope of the most \"extreme\" policies, such as tariffs, the bank wrote on Thursday.\\n\\nAnalysts at UBS Global Wealth Management, meanwhile, expect the S&P 500 to hit 6,600 next year, driven by advances in artificial intelligence, lower interest rates, tax cuts and deregulation. The index closed at 5,948.71 on Thursday.\\n\\nStill, an all-out trade war with China and other partners could hit U.S. growth and stoke inflation. A scenario in which countries retaliate against far-reaching U.S tariffs could send the S&P 500 to as low 5,100 - though global stocks would also decline, UBS said.\\n\\nCertain corners of the market could be particularly vulnerable to Trump\\'s policies: worries over plans for cutting bureaucratic excess bruised shares of government contractors last week, for example, while drugmakers fell when Trump picked vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\\n\\nBroad tax cuts could also spark concerns about adding to U.S. debt. Deficit worries have helped drive a recent selloff in U.S. government bonds, taking the 10-year Treasury yield to a five-month high last week.\\n\\nAt the same time, the valuation gap between the U.S. and the rest of the world could become so wide that U.S. stocks start looking expensive, or international equities become too cheap to ignore.\\n\\nFor now, however, the long-term trend is in favor of the U.S., with the S&P 500 gaining more than 180% against a rise of nearly 50% for Europe\\'s STOXX over the past decade. \"Momentum is a great thing,\" said Colin Graham, head of multi-asset strategies at Robeco. \"If you\\'ve got something that keeps outperforming, then investors will follow the money.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'theglobeandmail.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Globe and Mail'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/55R45Z2FXJH25E3ZRYNXCF6DAI.jpg?auth=3dcd34c09efc17697808a399cce618cf98dd18f1a1f24021b610552e0f0c6600&width=560&quality=80', 'eventUri': 'eng-10108049', 'sentiment': -0.07450980392156858, 'wgt': 249, 'relevance': 51}, {'uri': '8424627140', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-11-22', 'time': '22:05:38', 'dateTime': '2024-11-22T22:05:38Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-11-22T22:04:56Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9764705896377563, 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com/news/world/coreweave-targets-valuation-of-over-35-billion-in-2025-us-ipo-sources-say-11732312872937.html', 'title': 'CoreWeave targets valuation of over $35 billion in 2025 US IPO, sources say', 'body': \"NEW YORK, - Artificial intelligence cloud platform CoreWeave, is aiming for a valuation of more than $35 billion in its U.S. initial public offering that is expected to occur next year, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.\\n\\nRoseland, New Jersey-based CoreWeave is likely to target raising more than $3 billion from its share sale, which could launch during the second quarter of 2025, the sources said, cautioning that the company's plans are subject to market conditions and could change.\\n\\nThe discussions come at a time when investor interest in generative AI is sky-rocketing.

The order sought to limit the access that \"countries of concern\\'\\' -- specifically, China, Hong Kong and Macau -- have to American dollars to fund technologies that could be used, for example, to break codes or develop next-generation fighter jets. It will take effect Jan. 2.\\n\\n\"U.S. investments ... must not be used to help countries of concern develop their military, intelligence and cyber capabilities\\'\\'\\' said Paul Rosen, assistant Treasury secretary for investment security.

He also has imposed export controls to keep the Chinese from acquiring advanced computer chips and the equipment to produce them. Former President Donald Trump has vowed to dramatically increase taxes on all imports from China if voters send him back to the White House.\\n\\nThe Biden administration sought comment from businesses and from U.S. allies before putting out the final version.\\n\\nIn addition to blocking investments, the rule requires Americans and companies in the United States to notify the U.S. government of transactions that involve \"technologies and products that may contribute to a threat to the national security of the United States.\\'\\'\\n\\nViolators can be hit with fines of up to $368,136 or twice the value of the prohibited transaction, whichever is greater.

The order sought to limit the access that \"countries of concern\\'\\' -- specifically, China, Hong Kong and Macau -- have to American dollars to fund technologies that could be used, for example, to break codes or develop next-generation fighter jets. It will take effect Jan. 2.\\n\\n\"U.S. investments ... must not be used to help countries of concern develop their military, intelligence and cyber capabilities\\'\\'\\' said Paul Rosen, assistant Treasury secretary for investment security.

He also has imposed export controls to keep the Chinese from acquiring advanced computer chips and the equipment to produce them. Former President Donald Trump has vowed to dramatically increase taxes on all imports from China if voters send him back to the White House.\\n\\nThe Biden administration sought comment from businesses and from U.S. allies before putting out the final version.\\n\\nIn addition to blocking investments, the rule requires Americans and companies in the United States to notify the U.S. government of transactions that involve \"technologies and products that may contribute to a threat to the national security of the United States.\\'\\'\\n\\nViolators can be hit with fines of up to $368,136 or twice the value of the prohibited transaction, whichever is greater. Treasury is setting up an Office of Global Transactions to oversee the new rule.\\n\\nIn his weekly briefing on Tuesday, Hong Kong leader John Lee said the restrictions once again reflected some U.S. politicians were undermining normal investment and trade for their political interests, and these acts would cause harm to the global supply chain. Lee said the U.S. has enjoyed a trade surplus of $472 billion with Hong Kong in the past 10 years.\\n\\n\"In pursuing their political agenda, American politicians are harming not only others but also the interests of their own country, their people and their businesses.

It is in a prime area by the serene Xuan Huong Lake, one of Vietnam\\'s most picturesque natural lakes and a symbol of Da Lat.\\n\\nAccording to the plan, The One Destination will build Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard real estate complex on the last remaining prime land in Da Lat\\'s city center. Designed by renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, Haus Da Lat is expected to become a heritage symbol for the 130-year-old city and position Vietnam on the global ESG real estate map.\\n\\nThe decision of the international partners, to select Da Lat as their first investment destination in Vietnam highlights the city\\'s unique appeal. The partners emphasize that in a tropical country like Vietnam, Da Lat - a highland city with year-round cool weather surrounded by tranquil lakes, vast pine forests, magnificent waterfalls, and vibrant flower fields -- is a natural masterpiece. This city, often called a \"natural heritage,\" deserves real estate projects that reflect its value.\\n\\n\"We were captivated by Da Lat at first sight, and are proud to be one of the pioneering foreign investors in Da Lat\" said the representative of BTS.\\n\\nOn June 20, 2024, the Ministry of Transport issued Decision No. 758/QD-BGTVT to upgrade Lien Khuong Airport to an international airport, igniting a boom in Da Lat\\'s economy, tourism, and the entire Lam Dong province. In the first half of 2024, Lam Dong welcomed 5 million tourists, an increase of over 12%. By the end of 2024, the province is expected to receive 10 million visitors, including 550,000 international tourists. According to the 2030 plan, Lien Khuong Airport will expand to nearly 487 hectares and accommodate 5 million passengers annually, with flights from various countries worldwide.\\n\\nESG real estate is gaining traction in many developed countries and is expected to become a significant global trend in the next century. This is why the investors are partnering with The One Destination to launch a new era of ESG real estate in Vietnam, starting in Da Lat and expanding to other projects. With Vietnam\\'s dynamic economy ranking among Asia\\'s top, an average GDP growth of 6-7% annually, and a rapidly growing middle class expected to reach 40% of the population by 2030, the country\\'s real estate market is poised for a significant boom in the ESG segment. Leading companies like The One Destination will have the advantage in shaping this trend. Haus Da Lat is highly valued for its ESG-compliant design, choice of materials, construction, and operations, and focus on the human factor, aligning with the ESG goals, creating long-term value for future generations.\\n\\nCaroline Lee, Chairwoman of Terne Holdings, affirmed, \"Together with The One Destination and BTS, we will create a heritage landmark for Da Lat, Vietnam. We are proud to be among the pioneering foreign investors working alongside Vietnam\\'s real estate developers to build and preserve Da Lat in the face of the city\\'s concrete overdevelopment\".\\n\\nTerne Holdings also stated that the investment in Haus Da Lat aligns with its ongoing ESG strategy. This strategy is based on practical, measurable actions and aligns with 12 United Nations\\' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\n\\n\"The best is often saved for last, and Haus Da Lat will be Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard landmark project, a heritage for Da Lat,\" said a representative from The One Destination. Five leading international brands are also expected to join forces to create a new icon for Da Lat.\\n\\nReference Information\\n\\nThe One Destination stands at the forefront of ESG real estate development in Vietnam. We strive to address environmental challenges, minimize our ecological footprint and enhance the local environment by employing sustainable building materials and energy-efficient technologies.\\n\\nBTS Bernina Private Equity Fund is an open-end investment company whose size exceeding USD 368 million, with 60% invested in Asia.

At 22 times expected future earnings, its premium to an MSCI index of stocks of more than 40 other countries stands at its highest in more than two decades, according to LSEG Datastream.\\n\\nThough U.S. stocks have outperformed their counterparts for more than a decade, the valuation gap has widened this year thanks to resilient economic growth and strong corporate earnings - particularly for the technology sector, where excitement over developments in artificial intelligence have boosted the shares of companies such as chipmaker Nvidia.\\n\\nSome market participants believe Trump\\'s agenda of tax cuts, deregulation and even tariffs can further fuel U.S. exceptionalism, outweighing worries over their potentially disruptive nature and inflationary potential.\\n\\n\"Given the pro-growth tendencies of this new administration, I think it\\'s tough to fight the battle against U.S. equities, at least in 2025,\" said Venu Krishna, head of U.S. equity strategy at Barclays.\\n\\nSigns of a growing U.S. bias were evident immediately after the Nov. 5 election, when U.S. equity funds received more than $80 billion in the week following the vote while European and emerging market funds saw outflows, according to Deutsche Bank.\\n\\nStrategists at Morgan Stanley, UBS Global Wealth Management and the Wells Fargo Investment Institute are among those who recommend overweighting U.S. equities in portfolios or expect them to outperform next year.\\n\\nA critical driver of U.S. strength is corporate America\\'s profit edge: S&P 500 company earnings are expected to rise 9.9% this year and 14.2% in 2025, according to LSEG Datastream. Companies in Europe\\'s Stoxx 600, by contrast, are expected to increase earnings by 1.8% this year and 8.1% in 2025.\\n\\n\"The U.S. continues to be the geographic region of the world that generates the highest earnings growth and the most profitability,\" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\\n\\nThe dominant role of massive technology companies in the U.S. economy and their heavy weightings in indexes such as the S&P 500 are helping drive that growth. The five largest U.S. companies - Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com and Alphabet - have a combined market value of more than $14 trillion, compared with roughly $11 trillion for the entire STOXX 600, according to LSEG data.\\n\\nMore broadly, the U.S. economy is expected to grow by 2.8% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025, compared with 0.8% this year and 1.2% next year for a group of about 20 countries using the euro, according to forecasts from the International Monetary Fund.\\n\\nTrump\\'s plans to raise tariffs on imports could help the U.S. extend that advantage, despite the risk of some blowback, said Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners, who favors U.S. stocks.\\n\\n\"If Trump throws on a 10% to a 20% tariff on European goods, they\\'re going to get hurt more on a relative basis than we are,\" Mullaney said.\\n\\nRepublicans\\' lock on power in Washington - which could make it easier for Trump to enforce his agenda - prompted Deutsche Bank\\'s economists to raise their 2025 U.S. growth forecasts to 2.5% from 2.2%.\\n\\nWhile tax cuts and deregulation are expected to boost growth, relatively tight margins in U.S. Congress and the administration\\'s sensitivity to market reactions could limit the scope of the most \"extreme\" policies, such as tariffs, the bank wrote on Thursday.\\n\\nAnalysts at UBS Global Wealth Management, meanwhile, expect the S&P 500 to hit 6,600 next year, driven by advances in artificial intelligence, lower interest rates, tax cuts and deregulation. The index closed at 5,948.71 on Thursday.\\n\\nStill, an all-out trade war with China and other partners could hit U.S. growth and stoke inflation. A scenario in which countries retaliate against far-reaching U.S tariffs could send the S&P 500 to as low 5,100 - though global stocks would also decline, UBS said.\\n\\nCertain corners of the market could be particularly vulnerable to Trump\\'s policies: worries over plans for cutting bureaucratic excess bruised shares of government contractors last week, for example, while drugmakers fell when Trump picked vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\\n\\nBroad tax cuts could also spark concerns about adding to U.S. debt. Deficit worries have helped drive a recent selloff in U.S. government bonds, taking the 10-year Treasury yield to a five-month high last week.\\n\\nAt the same time, the valuation gap between the U.S. and the rest of the world could become so wide that U.S. stocks start looking expensive, or international equities become too cheap to ignore.\\n\\nFor now, however, the long-term trend is in favor of the U.S., with the S&P 500 gaining more than 180% against a rise of nearly 50% for Europe\\'s STOXX over the past decade. \"Momentum is a great thing,\" said Colin Graham, head of multi-asset strategies at Robeco. \"If you\\'ve got something that keeps outperforming, then investors will follow the money.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'theglobeandmail.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Globe and Mail'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/55R45Z2FXJH25E3ZRYNXCF6DAI.jpg?auth=3dcd34c09efc17697808a399cce618cf98dd18f1a1f24021b610552e0f0c6600&width=560&quality=80', 'eventUri': 'eng-10108049', 'sentiment': -0.07450980392156858, 'wgt': 249, 'relevance': 51}, {'uri': '8424627140', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-11-22', 'time': '22:05:38', 'dateTime': '2024-11-22T22:05:38Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-11-22T22:04:56Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9764705896377563, 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com/news/world/coreweave-targets-valuation-of-over-35-billion-in-2025-us-ipo-sources-say-11732312872937.html', 'title': 'CoreWeave targets valuation of over $35 billion in 2025 US IPO, sources say', 'body': \"NEW YORK, - Artificial intelligence cloud platform CoreWeave, is aiming for a valuation of more than $35 billion in its U.S. initial public offering that is expected to occur next year, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.\\n\\nRoseland, New Jersey-based CoreWeave is likely to target raising more than $3 billion from its share sale, which could launch during the second quarter of 2025, the sources said, cautioning that the company's plans are subject to market conditions and could change.\\n\\nThe discussions come at a time when investor interest in generative AI is sky-rocketing.

The gauge, which measures foreign direct investment in China, was down almost $13 billion for the first nine months of the year.\\n\\nForeign investment into China has slumped in the past three years after hitting a record in 2021, a casualty of geopolitical tensions, pessimism about the world\\'s second-largest economy and stronger competition from Chinese domestic firms in industries such as cars. Should the decline continue for the rest of the year, it would be the first annual net outflow in FDI since at least 1990, when comparable data begins.\\n\\nCompanies that have pulled back some China operations this year include automakers Nissan Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, along with others like Konica Minolta Inc.

Under the agreement, the joint venture arrangement of BTS and Terne Holdings will hold a 30% stake in The One Destination.\\n\\nThe One Destination is the developer of the Haus Da Lat project. The company is a leader in developing ESG real estate in Vietnam, actively engaged in numerous ongoing projects nationwide, and maintains a substantial land reserve. The project spans 5 hectares and has a total investment of VND 1.700 billion (~ USD 68m). It is in a prime area by the serene Xuan Huong Lake, one of Vietnam\\'s most picturesque natural lakes and a symbol of Da Lat.\\n\\nAccording to the plan, The One Destination will build Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard real estate complex on the last remaining prime land in Da Lat\\'s city center. Designed by renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, Haus Da Lat is expected to become a heritage symbol for the 130-year-old city and position Vietnam on the global ESG real estate map.\\n\\nThe decision of the international partners, to select Da Lat as their first investment destination in Vietnam highlights the city\\'s unique appeal. The partners emphasize that in a tropical country like Vietnam, Da Lat - a highland city with year-round cool weather surrounded by tranquil lakes, vast pine forests, magnificent waterfalls, and vibrant flower fields -- is a natural masterpiece. This city, often called a \"natural heritage,\" deserves real estate projects that reflect its value.\\n\\n\"We were captivated by Da Lat at first sight, and are proud to be one of the pioneering foreign investors in Da Lat\" said the representative of BTS.\\n\\nOn June 20, 2024, the Ministry of Transport issued Decision No. 758/QD-BGTVT to upgrade Lien Khuong Airport to an international airport, igniting a boom in Da Lat\\'s economy, tourism, and the entire Lam Dong province. In the first half of 2024, Lam Dong welcomed 5 million tourists, an increase of over 12%. By the end of 2024, the province is expected to receive 10 million visitors, including 550,000 international tourists. According to the 2030 plan, Lien Khuong Airport will expand to nearly 487 hectares and accommodate 5 million passengers annually, with flights from various countries worldwide.\\n\\nESG real estate is gaining traction in many developed countries and is expected to become a significant global trend in the next century. This is why the investors are partnering with The One Destination to launch a new era of ESG real estate in Vietnam, starting in Da Lat and expanding to other projects. With Vietnam\\'s dynamic economy ranking among Asia\\'s top, an average GDP growth of 6-7% annually, and a rapidly growing middle class expected to reach 40% of the population by 2030, the country\\'s real estate market is poised for a significant boom in the ESG segment. Leading companies like The One Destination will have the advantage in shaping this trend. Haus Da Lat is highly valued for its ESG-compliant design, choice of materials, construction, and operations, and focus on the human factor, aligning with the ESG goals, creating long-term value for future generations.\\n\\nCaroline Lee, Chairwoman of Terne Holdings, affirmed, \"Together with The One Destination and BTS, we will create a heritage landmark for Da Lat, Vietnam. We are proud to be among the pioneering foreign investors working alongside Vietnam\\'s real estate developers to build and preserve Da Lat in the face of the city\\'s concrete overdevelopment\".\\n\\nTerne Holdings also stated that the investment in Haus Da Lat aligns with its ongoing ESG strategy. This strategy is based on practical, measurable actions and aligns with 12 United Nations\\' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\n\\n\"The best is often saved for last, and Haus Da Lat will be Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard landmark project, a heritage for Da Lat,\" said a representative from The One Destination. Five leading international brands are also expected to join forces to create a new icon for Da Lat.\\n\\nReference Information\\n\\nThe One Destination stands at the forefront of ESG real estate development in Vietnam. We strive to address environmental challenges, minimize our ecological footprint and enhance the local environment by employing sustainable building materials and energy-efficient technologies.\\n\\nBTS Bernina Private Equity Fund is an open-end investment company whose size exceeding USD 368 million, with 60% invested in Asia.

At 22 times expected future earnings, its premium to an MSCI index of stocks of more than 40 other countries stands at its highest in more than two decades, according to LSEG Datastream.\\n\\nThough U.S. stocks have outperformed their counterparts for more than a decade, the valuation gap has widened this year thanks to resilient economic growth and strong corporate earnings - particularly for the technology sector, where excitement over developments in artificial intelligence have boosted the shares of companies such as chipmaker Nvidia.\\n\\nSome market participants believe Trump\\'s agenda of tax cuts, deregulation and even tariffs can further fuel U.S. exceptionalism, outweighing worries over their potentially disruptive nature and inflationary potential.\\n\\n\"Given the pro-growth tendencies of this new administration, I think it\\'s tough to fight the battle against U.S. equities, at least in 2025,\" said Venu Krishna, head of U.S. equity strategy at Barclays.\\n\\nSigns of a growing U.S. bias were evident immediately after the Nov. 5 election, when U.S. equity funds received more than $80 billion in the week following the vote while European and emerging market funds saw outflows, according to Deutsche Bank.\\n\\nStrategists at Morgan Stanley, UBS Global Wealth Management and the Wells Fargo Investment Institute are among those who recommend overweighting U.S. equities in portfolios or expect them to outperform next year.\\n\\nA critical driver of U.S. strength is corporate America\\'s profit edge: S&P 500 company earnings are expected to rise 9.9% this year and 14.2% in 2025, according to LSEG Datastream. Companies in Europe\\'s Stoxx 600, by contrast, are expected to increase earnings by 1.8% this year and 8.1% in 2025.\\n\\n\"The U.S. continues to be the geographic region of the world that generates the highest earnings growth and the most profitability,\" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\\n\\nThe dominant role of massive technology companies in the U.S. economy and their heavy weightings in indexes such as the S&P 500 are helping drive that growth. The five largest U.S. companies - Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com and Alphabet - have a combined market value of more than $14 trillion, compared with roughly $11 trillion for the entire STOXX 600, according to LSEG data.\\n\\nMore broadly, the U.S. economy is expected to grow by 2.8% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025, compared with 0.8% this year and 1.2% next year for a group of about 20 countries using the euro, according to forecasts from the International Monetary Fund.\\n\\nTrump\\'s plans to raise tariffs on imports could help the U.S. extend that advantage, despite the risk of some blowback, said Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners, who favors U.S. stocks.\\n\\n\"If Trump throws on a 10% to a 20% tariff on European goods, they\\'re going to get hurt more on a relative basis than we are,\" Mullaney said.\\n\\nRepublicans\\' lock on power in Washington - which could make it easier for Trump to enforce his agenda - prompted Deutsche Bank\\'s economists to raise their 2025 U.S. growth forecasts to 2.5% from 2.2%.\\n\\nWhile tax cuts and deregulation are expected to boost growth, relatively tight margins in U.S. Congress and the administration\\'s sensitivity to market reactions could limit the scope of the most \"extreme\" policies, such as tariffs, the bank wrote on Thursday.\\n\\nAnalysts at UBS Global Wealth Management, meanwhile, expect the S&P 500 to hit 6,600 next year, driven by advances in artificial intelligence, lower interest rates, tax cuts and deregulation. The index closed at 5,948.71 on Thursday.\\n\\nStill, an all-out trade war with China and other partners could hit U.S. growth and stoke inflation. A scenario in which countries retaliate against far-reaching U.S tariffs could send the S&P 500 to as low 5,100 - though global stocks would also decline, UBS said.\\n\\nCertain corners of the market could be particularly vulnerable to Trump\\'s policies: worries over plans for cutting bureaucratic excess bruised shares of government contractors last week, for example, while drugmakers fell when Trump picked vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\\n\\nBroad tax cuts could also spark concerns about adding to U.S. debt. Deficit worries have helped drive a recent selloff in U.S. government bonds, taking the 10-year Treasury yield to a five-month high last week.\\n\\nAt the same time, the valuation gap between the U.S. and the rest of the world could become so wide that U.S. stocks start looking expensive, or international equities become too cheap to ignore.\\n\\nFor now, however, the long-term trend is in favor of the U.S., with the S&P 500 gaining more than 180% against a rise of nearly 50% for Europe\\'s STOXX over the past decade. \"Momentum is a great thing,\" said Colin Graham, head of multi-asset strategies at Robeco. \"If you\\'ve got something that keeps outperforming, then investors will follow the money.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'theglobeandmail.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Globe and Mail'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/55R45Z2FXJH25E3ZRYNXCF6DAI.jpg?auth=3dcd34c09efc17697808a399cce618cf98dd18f1a1f24021b610552e0f0c6600&width=560&quality=80', 'eventUri': 'eng-10108049', 'sentiment': -0.07450980392156858, 'wgt': 249, 'relevance': 51}, {'uri': '8424627140', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-11-22', 'time': '22:05:38', 'dateTime': '2024-11-22T22:05:38Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-11-22T22:04:56Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9764705896377563, 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com/news/world/coreweave-targets-valuation-of-over-35-billion-in-2025-us-ipo-sources-say-11732312872937.html', 'title': 'CoreWeave targets valuation of over $35 billion in 2025 US IPO, sources say', 'body': \"NEW YORK, - Artificial intelligence cloud platform CoreWeave, is aiming for a valuation of more than $35 billion in its U.S. initial public offering that is expected to occur next year, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.\\n\\nRoseland, New Jersey-based CoreWeave is likely to target raising more than $3 billion from its share sale, which could launch during the second quarter of 2025, the sources said, cautioning that the company's plans are subject to market conditions and could change.\\n\\nThe discussions come at a time when investor interest in generative AI is sky-rocketing.

Under the agreement, the joint venture arrangement of BTS and Terne Holdings will hold a 30% stake in The One Destination.\\n\\nThe One Destination is the developer of the Haus Da Lat project. The company is a leader in developing ESG real estate in Vietnam, actively engaged in numerous ongoing projects nationwide, and maintains a substantial land reserve. The project spans 5 hectares and has a total investment of VND 1.700 billion (~ USD 68m). It is in a prime area by the serene Xuan Huong Lake, one of Vietnam\\'s most picturesque natural lakes and a symbol of Da Lat.\\n\\nAccording to the plan, The One Destination will build Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard real estate complex on the last remaining prime land in Da Lat\\'s city center. Designed by renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, Haus Da Lat is expected to become a heritage symbol for the 130-year-old city and position Vietnam on the global ESG real estate map.\\n\\nThe decision of the international partners, to select Da Lat as their first investment destination in Vietnam highlights the city\\'s unique appeal. The partners emphasize that in a tropical country like Vietnam, Da Lat - a highland city with year-round cool weather surrounded by tranquil lakes, vast pine forests, magnificent waterfalls, and vibrant flower fields -- is a natural masterpiece. This city, often called a \"natural heritage,\" deserves real estate projects that reflect its value.\\n\\n\"We were captivated by Da Lat at first sight, and are proud to be one of the pioneering foreign investors in Da Lat\" said the representative of BTS.\\n\\nOn June 20, 2024, the Ministry of Transport issued Decision No. 758/QD-BGTVT to upgrade Lien Khuong Airport to an international airport, igniting a boom in Da Lat\\'s economy, tourism, and the entire Lam Dong province. In the first half of 2024, Lam Dong welcomed 5 million tourists, an increase of over 12%. By the end of 2024, the province is expected to receive 10 million visitors, including 550,000 international tourists. According to the 2030 plan, Lien Khuong Airport will expand to nearly 487 hectares and accommodate 5 million passengers annually, with flights from various countries worldwide.\\n\\nESG real estate is gaining traction in many developed countries and is expected to become a significant global trend in the next century. This is why the investors are partnering with The One Destination to launch a new era of ESG real estate in Vietnam, starting in Da Lat and expanding to other projects. With Vietnam\\'s dynamic economy ranking among Asia\\'s top, an average GDP growth of 6-7% annually, and a rapidly growing middle class expected to reach 40% of the population by 2030, the country\\'s real estate market is poised for a significant boom in the ESG segment. Leading companies like The One Destination will have the advantage in shaping this trend. Haus Da Lat is highly valued for its ESG-compliant design, choice of materials, construction, and operations, and focus on the human factor, aligning with the ESG goals, creating long-term value for future generations.\\n\\nCaroline Lee, Chairwoman of Terne Holdings, affirmed, \"Together with The One Destination and BTS, we will create a heritage landmark for Da Lat, Vietnam. We are proud to be among the pioneering foreign investors working alongside Vietnam\\'s real estate developers to build and preserve Da Lat in the face of the city\\'s concrete overdevelopment\".\\n\\nTerne Holdings also stated that the investment in Haus Da Lat aligns with its ongoing ESG strategy. This strategy is based on practical, measurable actions and aligns with 12 United Nations\\' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\n\\n\"The best is often saved for last, and Haus Da Lat will be Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard landmark project, a heritage for Da Lat,\" said a representative from The One Destination. Five leading international brands are also expected to join forces to create a new icon for Da Lat.\\n\\nReference Information\\n\\nThe One Destination stands at the forefront of ESG real estate development in Vietnam. We strive to address environmental challenges, minimize our ecological footprint and enhance the local environment by employing sustainable building materials and energy-efficient technologies.\\n\\nBTS Bernina Private Equity Fund is an open-end investment company whose size exceeding USD 368 million, with 60% invested in Asia. Over the past three years, the fund\\'s performance has reached 71.9%.\\n\\nTerne Holdings is a multi-sector investment enterprise based in Singapore focuses on investments in creating ecological spaces that preserve the beauty of nature, prioritize health, and build strong communities.\\n\\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-one-destination-together-with-a-singapore-investor-and-an-institutional-fund-collaborate-to-build-vietnams-first-esg-real-estate-complex-in-da-lat-302299732.html', 'source': {'uri': 'streetinsider.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'StreetInsider.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png', 'eventUri': 'eng-10072106', 'sentiment': 0.3568627450980393, 'wgt': 251, 'relevance': 56}, {'uri': '2024-11-532410294', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-11-01', 'time': '03:04:36', 'dateTime': '2024-11-01T03:04:36Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-10-31T22:12:00Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9843137264251709, 'url': 'https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2024-10-31/asia-markets-start-momentous-month-on-cautious-side-us-payrolls-awaited', 'title': 'Asia Markets Start Momentous Month on Cautious Side, US Payrolls Awaited', 'body': 'SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian markets started a likely momentous month on the cautious side, with shares mostly lower and Treasury yields near three-month highs on Friday, while investors wait for U.S. payrolls data, although a rate cut next week is largely baked in.\\n\\nInvestors are awaiting Friday\\'s nonfarm payrolls report, ahead of Tuesday\\'s U.S. presidential election and Federal Reserve\\'s policy meeting a day later.\\n\\nOil extended its rally, with Brent prices up almost 2% to $74.13 a barrel, on reports that Iran was preparing a retaliatory strike on Israel from Iraqi territory in the coming days.

At 22 times expected future earnings, its premium to an MSCI index of stocks of more than 40 other countries stands at its highest in more than two decades, according to LSEG Datastream.\\n\\nThough U.S. stocks have outperformed their counterparts for more than a decade, the valuation gap has widened this year thanks to resilient economic growth and strong corporate earnings - particularly for the technology sector, where excitement over developments in artificial intelligence have boosted the shares of companies such as chipmaker Nvidia.\\n\\nSome market participants believe Trump\\'s agenda of tax cuts, deregulation and even tariffs can further fuel U.S. exceptionalism, outweighing worries over their potentially disruptive nature and inflationary potential.\\n\\n\"Given the pro-growth tendencies of this new administration, I think it\\'s tough to fight the battle against U.S. equities, at least in 2025,\" said Venu Krishna, head of U.S. equity strategy at Barclays.\\n\\nSigns of a growing U.S. bias were evident immediately after the Nov. 5 election, when U.S. equity funds received more than $80 billion in the week following the vote while European and emerging market funds saw outflows, according to Deutsche Bank.\\n\\nStrategists at Morgan Stanley, UBS Global Wealth Management and the Wells Fargo Investment Institute are among those who recommend overweighting U.S. equities in portfolios or expect them to outperform next year.\\n\\nA critical driver of U.S. strength is corporate America\\'s profit edge: S&P 500 company earnings are expected to rise 9.9% this year and 14.2% in 2025, according to LSEG Datastream. Companies in Europe\\'s Stoxx 600, by contrast, are expected to increase earnings by 1.8% this year and 8.1% in 2025.\\n\\n\"The U.S. continues to be the geographic region of the world that generates the highest earnings growth and the most profitability,\" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\\n\\nThe dominant role of massive technology companies in the U.S. economy and their heavy weightings in indexes such as the S&P 500 are helping drive that growth. The five largest U.S. companies - Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com and Alphabet - have a combined market value of more than $14 trillion, compared with roughly $11 trillion for the entire STOXX 600, according to LSEG data.\\n\\nMore broadly, the U.S. economy is expected to grow by 2.8% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025, compared with 0.8% this year and 1.2% next year for a group of about 20 countries using the euro, according to forecasts from the International Monetary Fund.\\n\\nTrump\\'s plans to raise tariffs on imports could help the U.S. extend that advantage, despite the risk of some blowback, said Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners, who favors U.S. stocks.\\n\\n\"If Trump throws on a 10% to a 20% tariff on European goods, they\\'re going to get hurt more on a relative basis than we are,\" Mullaney said.\\n\\nRepublicans\\' lock on power in Washington - which could make it easier for Trump to enforce his agenda - prompted Deutsche Bank\\'s economists to raise their 2025 U.S. growth forecasts to 2.5% from 2.2%.\\n\\nWhile tax cuts and deregulation are expected to boost growth, relatively tight margins in U.S. Congress and the administration\\'s sensitivity to market reactions could limit the scope of the most \"extreme\" policies, such as tariffs, the bank wrote on Thursday.\\n\\nAnalysts at UBS Global Wealth Management, meanwhile, expect the S&P 500 to hit 6,600 next year, driven by advances in artificial intelligence, lower interest rates, tax cuts and deregulation. The index closed at 5,948.71 on Thursday.\\n\\nStill, an all-out trade war with China and other partners could hit U.S. growth and stoke inflation. A scenario in which countries retaliate against far-reaching U.S tariffs could send the S&P 500 to as low 5,100 - though global stocks would also decline, UBS said.\\n\\nCertain corners of the market could be particularly vulnerable to Trump\\'s policies: worries over plans for cutting bureaucratic excess bruised shares of government contractors last week, for example, while drugmakers fell when Trump picked vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\\n\\nBroad tax cuts could also spark concerns about adding to U.S. debt. Deficit worries have helped drive a recent selloff in U.S. government bonds, taking the 10-year Treasury yield to a five-month high last week.\\n\\nAt the same time, the valuation gap between the U.S. and the rest of the world could become so wide that U.S. stocks start looking expensive, or international equities become too cheap to ignore.\\n\\nFor now, however, the long-term trend is in favor of the U.S., with the S&P 500 gaining more than 180% against a rise of nearly 50% for Europe\\'s STOXX over the past decade. \"Momentum is a great thing,\" said Colin Graham, head of multi-asset strategies at Robeco. \"If you\\'ve got something that keeps outperforming, then investors will follow the money.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'theglobeandmail.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Globe and Mail'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/55R45Z2FXJH25E3ZRYNXCF6DAI.jpg?auth=3dcd34c09efc17697808a399cce618cf98dd18f1a1f24021b610552e0f0c6600&width=560&quality=80', 'eventUri': 'eng-10108049', 'sentiment': -0.07450980392156858, 'wgt': 249, 'relevance': 51}, {'uri': '8424627140', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-11-22', 'time': '22:05:38', 'dateTime': '2024-11-22T22:05:38Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-11-22T22:04:56Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9764705896377563, 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com/news/world/coreweave-targets-valuation-of-over-35-billion-in-2025-us-ipo-sources-say-11732312872937.html', 'title': 'CoreWeave targets valuation of over $35 billion in 2025 US IPO, sources say', 'body': \"NEW YORK, - Artificial intelligence cloud platform CoreWeave, is aiming for a valuation of more than $35 billion in its U.S. initial public offering that is expected to occur next year, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.\\n\\nRoseland, New Jersey-based CoreWeave is likely to target raising more than $3 billion from its share sale, which could launch during the second quarter of 2025, the sources said, cautioning that the company's plans are subject to market conditions and could change.\\n\\nThe discussions come at a time when investor interest in generative AI is sky-rocketing.

The order sought to limit the access that \"countries of concern\\'\\' -- specifically, China, Hong Kong and Macau -- have to American dollars to fund technologies that could be used, for example, to break codes or develop next-generation fighter jets. It will take effect Jan. 2.\\n\\n\"U.S. investments ... must not be used to help countries of concern develop their military, intelligence and cyber capabilities\\'\\'\\' said Paul Rosen, assistant Treasury secretary for investment security.

He also has imposed export controls to keep the Chinese from acquiring advanced computer chips and the equipment to produce them. Former President Donald Trump has vowed to dramatically increase taxes on all imports from China if voters send him back to the White House.\\n\\nThe Biden administration sought comment from businesses and from U.S. allies before putting out the final version.\\n\\nIn addition to blocking investments, the rule requires Americans and companies in the United States to notify the U.S. government of transactions that involve \"technologies and products that may contribute to a threat to the national security of the United States.\\'\\'\\n\\nViolators can be hit with fines of up to $368,136 or twice the value of the prohibited transaction, whichever is greater.

The order sought to limit the access that \"countries of concern\\'\\' -- specifically, China, Hong Kong and Macau -- have to American dollars to fund technologies that could be used, for example, to break codes or develop next-generation fighter jets. It will take effect Jan. 2.\\n\\n\"U.S. investments ... must not be used to help countries of concern develop their military, intelligence and cyber capabilities\\'\\'\\' said Paul Rosen, assistant Treasury secretary for investment security.

He also has imposed export controls to keep the Chinese from acquiring advanced computer chips and the equipment to produce them. Former President Donald Trump has vowed to dramatically increase taxes on all imports from China if voters send him back to the White House.\\n\\nThe Biden administration sought comment from businesses and from U.S. allies before putting out the final version.\\n\\nIn addition to blocking investments, the rule requires Americans and companies in the United States to notify the U.S. government of transactions that involve \"technologies and products that may contribute to a threat to the national security of the United States.\\'\\'\\n\\nViolators can be hit with fines of up to $368,136 or twice the value of the prohibited transaction, whichever is greater. Treasury is setting up an Office of Global Transactions to oversee the new rule.\\n\\nIn his weekly briefing on Tuesday, Hong Kong leader John Lee said the restrictions once again reflected some U.S. politicians were undermining normal investment and trade for their political interests, and these acts would cause harm to the global supply chain. Lee said the U.S. has enjoyed a trade surplus of $472 billion with Hong Kong in the past 10 years.\\n\\n\"In pursuing their political agenda, American politicians are harming not only others but also the interests of their own country, their people and their businesses.

It is in a prime area by the serene Xuan Huong Lake, one of Vietnam\\'s most picturesque natural lakes and a symbol of Da Lat.\\n\\nAccording to the plan, The One Destination will build Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard real estate complex on the last remaining prime land in Da Lat\\'s city center. Designed by renowned Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, Haus Da Lat is expected to become a heritage symbol for the 130-year-old city and position Vietnam on the global ESG real estate map.\\n\\nThe decision of the international partners, to select Da Lat as their first investment destination in Vietnam highlights the city\\'s unique appeal. The partners emphasize that in a tropical country like Vietnam, Da Lat - a highland city with year-round cool weather surrounded by tranquil lakes, vast pine forests, magnificent waterfalls, and vibrant flower fields -- is a natural masterpiece. This city, often called a \"natural heritage,\" deserves real estate projects that reflect its value.\\n\\n\"We were captivated by Da Lat at first sight, and are proud to be one of the pioneering foreign investors in Da Lat\" said the representative of BTS.\\n\\nOn June 20, 2024, the Ministry of Transport issued Decision No. 758/QD-BGTVT to upgrade Lien Khuong Airport to an international airport, igniting a boom in Da Lat\\'s economy, tourism, and the entire Lam Dong province. In the first half of 2024, Lam Dong welcomed 5 million tourists, an increase of over 12%. By the end of 2024, the province is expected to receive 10 million visitors, including 550,000 international tourists. According to the 2030 plan, Lien Khuong Airport will expand to nearly 487 hectares and accommodate 5 million passengers annually, with flights from various countries worldwide.\\n\\nESG real estate is gaining traction in many developed countries and is expected to become a significant global trend in the next century. This is why the investors are partnering with The One Destination to launch a new era of ESG real estate in Vietnam, starting in Da Lat and expanding to other projects. With Vietnam\\'s dynamic economy ranking among Asia\\'s top, an average GDP growth of 6-7% annually, and a rapidly growing middle class expected to reach 40% of the population by 2030, the country\\'s real estate market is poised for a significant boom in the ESG segment. Leading companies like The One Destination will have the advantage in shaping this trend. Haus Da Lat is highly valued for its ESG-compliant design, choice of materials, construction, and operations, and focus on the human factor, aligning with the ESG goals, creating long-term value for future generations.\\n\\nCaroline Lee, Chairwoman of Terne Holdings, affirmed, \"Together with The One Destination and BTS, we will create a heritage landmark for Da Lat, Vietnam. We are proud to be among the pioneering foreign investors working alongside Vietnam\\'s real estate developers to build and preserve Da Lat in the face of the city\\'s concrete overdevelopment\".\\n\\nTerne Holdings also stated that the investment in Haus Da Lat aligns with its ongoing ESG strategy. This strategy is based on practical, measurable actions and aligns with 12 United Nations\\' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\n\\n\"The best is often saved for last, and Haus Da Lat will be Vietnam\\'s first ESG-standard landmark project, a heritage for Da Lat,\" said a representative from The One Destination. Five leading international brands are also expected to join forces to create a new icon for Da Lat.\\n\\nReference Information\\n\\nThe One Destination stands at the forefront of ESG real estate development in Vietnam. We strive to address environmental challenges, minimize our ecological footprint and enhance the local environment by employing sustainable building materials and energy-efficient technologies.\\n\\nBTS Bernina Private Equity Fund is an open-end investment company whose size exceeding USD 368 million, with 60% invested in Asia.

At 22 times expected future earnings, its premium to an MSCI index of stocks of more than 40 other countries stands at its highest in more than two decades, according to LSEG Datastream.\\n\\nThough U.S. stocks have outperformed their counterparts for more than a decade, the valuation gap has widened this year thanks to resilient economic growth and strong corporate earnings - particularly for the technology sector, where excitement over developments in artificial intelligence have boosted the shares of companies such as chipmaker Nvidia.\\n\\nSome market participants believe Trump\\'s agenda of tax cuts, deregulation and even tariffs can further fuel U.S. exceptionalism, outweighing worries over their potentially disruptive nature and inflationary potential.\\n\\n\"Given the pro-growth tendencies of this new administration, I think it\\'s tough to fight the battle against U.S. equities, at least in 2025,\" said Venu Krishna, head of U.S. equity strategy at Barclays.\\n\\nSigns of a growing U.S. bias were evident immediately after the Nov. 5 election, when U.S. equity funds received more than $80 billion in the week following the vote while European and emerging market funds saw outflows, according to Deutsche Bank.\\n\\nStrategists at Morgan Stanley, UBS Global Wealth Management and the Wells Fargo Investment Institute are among those who recommend overweighting U.S. equities in portfolios or expect them to outperform next year.\\n\\nA critical driver of U.S. strength is corporate America\\'s profit edge: S&P 500 company earnings are expected to rise 9.9% this year and 14.2% in 2025, according to LSEG Datastream. Companies in Europe\\'s Stoxx 600, by contrast, are expected to increase earnings by 1.8% this year and 8.1% in 2025.\\n\\n\"The U.S. continues to be the geographic region of the world that generates the highest earnings growth and the most profitability,\" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\\n\\nThe dominant role of massive technology companies in the U.S. economy and their heavy weightings in indexes such as the S&P 500 are helping drive that growth. The five largest U.S. companies - Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com and Alphabet - have a combined market value of more than $14 trillion, compared with roughly $11 trillion for the entire STOXX 600, according to LSEG data.\\n\\nMore broadly, the U.S. economy is expected to grow by 2.8% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025, compared with 0.8% this year and 1.2% next year for a group of about 20 countries using the euro, according to forecasts from the International Monetary Fund.\\n\\nTrump\\'s plans to raise tariffs on imports could help the U.S. extend that advantage, despite the risk of some blowback, said Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners, who favors U.S. stocks.\\n\\n\"If Trump throws on a 10% to a 20% tariff on European goods, they\\'re going to get hurt more on a relative basis than we are,\" Mullaney said.\\n\\nRepublicans\\' lock on power in Washington - which could make it easier for Trump to enforce his agenda - prompted Deutsche Bank\\'s economists to raise their 2025 U.S. growth forecasts to 2.5% from 2.2%.\\n\\nWhile tax cuts and deregulation are expected to boost growth, relatively tight margins in U.S. Congress and the administration\\'s sensitivity to market reactions could limit the scope of the most \"extreme\" policies, such as tariffs, the bank wrote on Thursday.\\n\\nAnalysts at UBS Global Wealth Management, meanwhile, expect the S&P 500 to hit 6,600 next year, driven by advances in artificial intelligence, lower interest rates, tax cuts and deregulation. The index closed at 5,948.71 on Thursday.\\n\\nStill, an all-out trade war with China and other partners could hit U.S. growth and stoke inflation. A scenario in which countries retaliate against far-reaching U.S tariffs could send the S&P 500 to as low 5,100 - though global stocks would also decline, UBS said.\\n\\nCertain corners of the market could be particularly vulnerable to Trump\\'s policies: worries over plans for cutting bureaucratic excess bruised shares of government contractors last week, for example, while drugmakers fell when Trump picked vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\\n\\nBroad tax cuts could also spark concerns about adding to U.S. debt. Deficit worries have helped drive a recent selloff in U.S. government bonds, taking the 10-year Treasury yield to a five-month high last week.\\n\\nAt the same time, the valuation gap between the U.S. and the rest of the world could become so wide that U.S. stocks start looking expensive, or international equities become too cheap to ignore.\\n\\nFor now, however, the long-term trend is in favor of the U.S., with the S&P 500 gaining more than 180% against a rise of nearly 50% for Europe\\'s STOXX over the past decade. \"Momentum is a great thing,\" said Colin Graham, head of multi-asset strategies at Robeco. \"If you\\'ve got something that keeps outperforming, then investors will follow the money.\"', 'source': {'uri': 'theglobeandmail.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Globe and Mail'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/55R45Z2FXJH25E3ZRYNXCF6DAI.jpg?auth=3dcd34c09efc17697808a399cce618cf98dd18f1a1f24021b610552e0f0c6600&width=560&quality=80', 'eventUri': 'eng-10108049', 'sentiment': -0.07450980392156858, 'wgt': 249, 'relevance': 51}, {'uri': '8424627140', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-11-22', 'time': '22:05:38', 'dateTime': '2024-11-22T22:05:38Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-11-22T22:04:56Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9764705896377563, 'url': 'https://www.livemint.com/news/world/coreweave-targets-valuation-of-over-35-billion-in-2025-us-ipo-sources-say-11732312872937.html', 'title': 'CoreWeave targets valuation of over $35 billion in 2025 US IPO, sources say', 'body': \"NEW YORK, - Artificial intelligence cloud platform CoreWeave, is aiming for a valuation of more than $35 billion in its U.S. initial public offering that is expected to occur next year, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.\\n\\nRoseland, New Jersey-based CoreWeave is likely to target raising more than $3 billion from its share sale, which could launch during the second quarter of 2025, the sources said, cautioning that the company's plans are subject to market conditions and could change.\\n\\nThe discussions come at a time when investor interest in generative AI is sky-rocketing.

This peak represents a significant milestone for the company, reflecting a robust upward trend over the past year. Investors have shown increased confidence in Mednax, as evidenced by the impressive 1-year change data, which shows a substantial increase of 58.81%. This surge in stock value underscores the company\\'s strong performance and the positive sentiment surrounding its future prospects in the market.\\n\\nIn other recent news, Pediatrix reported notable third-quarter results, surpassing projections with consistent unit revenue growth and steady patient volumes. The company has successfully transitioned to a hybrid revenue cycle management structure and is finalizing a $200 million revenue portfolio restructuring plan. This strategy is anticipated to result in a $30 million annualized improvement in adjusted EBITDA. The adjusted EBITDA outlook for the year has been refined to between $205 million and $215 million. Pediatrix\\'s operating cash flow has increased, and net debt has decreased, preparing the company to reduce borrowing in early 2025.\\n\\nThe company\\'s strong performance in maternal-fetal medicine and a 5% increase in same-unit revenue were highlighted. Pediatrix has also successfully renegotiated contracts with hospital partners. Despite uncertainties about future performance improvements from the revenue cycle management transition, the company is optimistic about potential Mergers and Acquisitions opportunities as leverage decreases.\\n\\nThese recent developments indicate Pediatrix\\'s solid financial health and clear strategy for future growth. The company\\'s proactive approach to restructuring and efficient use of cash reserves demonstrates a commitment to sustained financial stability.\\n\\nMednax Inc\\'s recent stock performance aligns with several key insights from InvestingPro.

(NYSE: MD), a leading provider of physician services, today reported earnings of $0.23 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024. On a non-GAAP basis, Pediatrix reported Adjusted EPS of $0.44.\\n\\nFor the 2024 third quarter, Pediatrix reported the following results:\\n\\nNet revenue of $511 million;Net income of $19 million; andAdjusted EBITDA of $60 million.\\n\\n\"Our third quarter operating results modestly exceeded our expectations, driven primarily by strength in same-unit revenue,\" said James D. Swift, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Pediatrix Medical Group. \"During the quarter, we successfully completed our previously announced transition to a hybrid revenue cycle management structure, and we remain on track to complete our portfolio management plans by the end of 2024. We believe that a more focused portfolio, with enhanced support for our affiliated practices, will enable stronger financial performance and benefit all of our stakeholders.\"\\n\\nOperating Results- Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\\n\\nPediatrix\\'s net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $511.2 million, compared to $506.6 million for the prior-year period. This increase reflected growth in same-unit revenue of 5.2 percent, partially offset by the impact of non-same unit activity, primarily practice dispositions.\\n\\nSame-unit revenue from net reimbursement-related factors increased by 3.4 percent for the 2024 third quarter as compared to the prior-year period. This increase primarily reflects improved payor mix and modest improvements in hospital contract administrative fees. The percentage of services reimbursed by commercial and other non-government payors increased by approximately 250 basis points compared to the prior year period.\\n\\nSame-unit revenue attributable to patient volume increased by 1.8 percent for the 2024 third quarter as compared to the prior-year period. Shown below are year-over-year percentage changes in certain same-unit volume statistics for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. (Note: figures in the below table reflect contributions only to net patient service revenue and exclude other contributions to total same-unit revenue, including contract and administrative fees.)\\n\\nThree Months Ended\\n\\nSeptember 30, 2024\\n\\nNine Months Ended\\n\\nSeptember 30, 2024\\n\\nHospital-based patient services\\n\\n1.6%\\n\\n1.7%\\n\\nOffice-based patient services\\n\\n3.8%\\n\\n2.5%\\n\\nNeonatology services (within hospital-based services):\\n\\nNeonatal intensive care unit (NICU) days\\n\\n0.4%\\n\\n0.8%\\n\\nFor the 2024 third quarter, practice salaries and benefits expense was $364.9 million, compared to $368.4 million for the prior-year period. This comparison primarily reflects the impact of practice disposition activity and a decrease in same-unit medical malpractice expense, partially offset by increases in same-unit clinical compensation costs, including incentive compensation based on practice results.\\n\\nFor the 2024 third quarter, general and administrative expenses were $58.1 million, as compared to $57.4 million for the prior-year period. This comparison primarily reflects higher incentive compensation based on financial results and increased internal staffing as part of the Company\\'s development of its hybrid revenue cycle management structure, largely offset by net staffing reductions.\\n\\nFor 2024 third quarter, transformational and restructuring related expenses totaled $18.6 million. These expenses related primarily to revenue cycle management transition activities and practice dispositions.\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA, which is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, transformational and restructuring related expenses, and loss on disposal of businesses, was $60.2 million for the 2024 third quarter, compared to $50.4 million for the prior-year period.\\n\\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $6.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $9.2 million for the prior-year period. This comparison was primarily related to a decrease in depreciation expense related to non-same unit activity, primarily practice dispositions.\\n\\nInterest expense was $10.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $10.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\\n\\nPediatrix generated net income of $19.4 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the 2024 third quarter, based on a weighted average 84.5 million shares outstanding. This compares with net income of $21.4 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the 2023 third quarter, based on a weighted average 83.0 million shares outstanding.\\n\\nFor the third quarter of 2024, Pediatrix reported Adjusted EPS of $0.44, compared to $0.32 for the third quarter of 2023. For these periods, Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted income per common and common equivalent share excluding non-cash amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, transformational and restructuring related expenses, loss on disposal of businesses, tax effects of goodwill impairment and discrete tax events.\\n\\nOperating Results - Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\\n\\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Pediatrix generated revenue of $1.51 billion, compared to $1.50 billion for the prior-year period. Pediatrix generated a net loss of $129.5 million, or $1.56 per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, based on a weighted average 83.2 million shares outstanding, which compares to income of $63.9 million, or $0.77 per share, based on a weighted average 82.5 million shares outstanding for the first nine months of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $155.3 million, compared to $149.6 million for the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Pediatrix reported Adjusted EPS of $0.99, compared to $0.94 in the same period of 2023.\\n\\nFinancial Position and Cash Flow - Continuing Operations\\n\\nPediatrix had cash and cash equivalents of $103.8 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $73.3 million at December 31, 2023, and net accounts receivable at September 30, 2024 were $286.9 million.\\n\\nFor the third quarter of 2024, Pediatrix generated cash from continuing operations of $95.7 million, compared to $81.1 million during the third quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company used $6.3 million to fund capital expenditures.\\n\\nAt September 30, 2024, Pediatrix had total debt outstanding of $619 million, consisting of its $400 million in 5.375% Senior Notes due 2030 and $219 million in borrowings under its Term A Loan.

(NYSE: MD), a leading provider of physician services, today reported earnings of $0.23 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024. On a non-GAAP basis, Pediatrix reported Adjusted EPS of $0.44.\\n\\nFor the 2024 third quarter, Pediatrix reported the following results:\\n\\nNet revenue of $511 million;Net income of $19 million; andAdjusted EBITDA of $60 million.\\n\\n\"Our third quarter operating results modestly exceeded our expectations, driven primarily by strength in same-unit revenue,\" said James D. Swift, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Pediatrix Medical Group. \"During the quarter, we successfully completed our previously announced transition to a hybrid revenue cycle management structure, and we remain on track to complete our portfolio management plans by the end of 2024. We believe that a more focused portfolio, with enhanced support for our affiliated practices, will enable stronger financial performance and benefit all of our stakeholders.\"\\n\\nOperating Results- Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\\n\\nPediatrix\\'s net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $511.2 million, compared to $506.6 million for the prior-year period. This increase reflected growth in same-unit revenue of 5.2 percent, partially offset by the impact of non-same unit activity, primarily practice dispositions.\\n\\nSame-unit revenue from net reimbursement-related factors increased by 3.4 percent for the 2024 third quarter as compared to the prior-year period. This increase primarily reflects improved payor mix and modest improvements in hospital contract administrative fees. The percentage of services reimbursed by commercial and other non-government payors increased by approximately 250 basis points compared to the prior year period.\\n\\nSame-unit revenue attributable to patient volume increased by 1.8 percent for the 2024 third quarter as compared to the prior-year period. Shown below are year-over-year percentage changes in certain same-unit volume statistics for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

This comparison primarily reflects the impact of practice disposition activity and a decrease in same-unit medical malpractice expense, partially offset by increases in same-unit clinical compensation costs, including incentive compensation based on practice results.\\n\\nFor the 2024 third quarter, general and administrative expenses were $58.1 million, as compared to $57.4 million for the prior-year period. This comparison primarily reflects higher incentive compensation based on financial results and increased internal staffing as part of the Company\\'s development of its hybrid revenue cycle management structure, largely offset by net staffing reductions.\\n\\nFor 2024 third quarter, transformational and restructuring related expenses totaled $18.6 million. These expenses related primarily to revenue cycle management transition activities and practice dispositions.\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA, which is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, transformational and restructuring related expenses, and loss on disposal of businesses, was $60.2 million for the 2024 third quarter, compared to $50.4 million for the prior-year period.\\n\\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $6.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $9.2 million for the prior-year period. This comparison was primarily related to a decrease in depreciation expense related to non-same unit activity, primarily practice dispositions.\\n\\nInterest expense was $10.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $10.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\\n\\nPediatrix generated net income of $19.4 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the 2024 third quarter, based on a weighted average 84.5 million shares outstanding. This compares with net income of $21.4 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the 2023 third quarter, based on a weighted average 83.0 million shares outstanding.\\n\\nFor the third quarter of 2024, Pediatrix reported Adjusted EPS of $0.44, compared to $0.32 for the third quarter of 2023. For these periods, Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted income per common and common equivalent share excluding non-cash amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, transformational and restructuring related expenses, loss on disposal of businesses, tax effects of goodwill impairment and discrete tax events.\\n\\nOperating Results - Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\\n\\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Pediatrix generated revenue of $1.51 billion, compared to $1.50 billion for the prior-year period. Pediatrix generated a net loss of $129.5 million, or $1.56 per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, based on a weighted average 83.2 million shares outstanding, which compares to income of $63.9 million, or $0.77 per share, based on a weighted average 82.5 million shares outstanding for the first nine months of 2023.

At September 30, 2024, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its $450 million revolving line of credit.\\n\\nPortfolio Management Update\\n\\nAs previously disclosed, during the second quarter of 2024, Pediatrix formalized its practice portfolio management plans, resulting in a decision to exit almost all of its affiliated office-based practices, other than maternal-fetal medicine, and during and subsequent to the end of the 2024 second quarter, the Company completed the exit of its primary and urgent care service line through two separate transactions. In aggregate, the office-based practices that the Company intends to exit and the primary and urgent care clinics that have been divested contributed net revenue of approximately $200 million in 2023. As previously disclosed, Pediatrix expects that the annualized favorable impact to Adjusted EBITDA resulting from its portfolio management plans to be approximately $30 million, based on 2023 financial information.\\n\\nThe Company continues to expect to complete these exits prior to the end of 2024.\\n\\n2024 Outlook\\n\\nPediatrix anticipates that its 2024 Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, will be in a range of $205 million to $215 million.

It's helpful to think of estate planning as a process rather than something that's one-and-done and begins and ends in an attorney's office.\\n\\nStart by asking other financial professionals who you work with -- whether a financial advisor or an accountant -- for recommendations. If you have a specific situation that is likely to affect your estate plan -- for example, if you're a small-business owner or if you have a child with special needs -- be sure to ask for referrals to attorneys who are well-versed in those areas.\\n\\nBefore you select an attorney, it's perfectly reasonable to conduct a basic informational interview.\\n\\nAs you speak with a prospective estate-planning attorney, also weigh the intangibles. Do you like this person, and would you be comfortable supplying him or her with personal information about your finances and family situation?\\n\\nStep 2: Take Stock of Your Assets\\n\\nSpend time enumerating your assets and their value: your investment accounts as well as life insurance, personal assets such as your home, and your share of any businesses that you own. You should also gather current information about any debts outstanding. Your estate-planning attorney is likely to provide you with a worksheet to document your assets and liabilities, but it's helpful to collect this information in advance.\\n\\nStep 3: Identify Key Individuals\\n\\nYou'll need individuals to fill the following key roles. Note that the same individual can fulfill more than one role.\\n\\nExecutor: A person who gathers all of your assets and makes sure that they are distributed as spelled out in your will. Many people call upon family members to serve as executors, but it's also possible -- and in some cases desirable -- to hire a professional.\\n\\nDurable (or Financial) Power of Attorney: A durable power of attorney is a document that grants an individual the legal authority to make financial decisions on your behalf if you should become disabled and unable to manage your own financial affairs.\\n\\nPower of Attorney for Healthcare: A power of attorney for healthcare is a document that specifies whom you entrust with making healthcare decisions on your behalf if you are disabled and unable to make them on your own.\\n\\nGuardian: A person who would look after your children if you and your spouse were to die when your children are minors.\\n\\nStep 4: Know the Key Documents You Need\\n\\nAt a minimum, you should ask your attorney to draft the following:\\n\\nLast Will and Testament: A legal document that tells everyone -- including your heirs -- how you would like your assets distributed after you're gone.\\n\\nLiving Will: A document that tells your loved ones and your healthcare providers how you would like to be cared for if you should become terminally ill.\\n\\nStep 5: Manage Your Documents\\n\\nOnce your estate-planning documents are drafted, destroy any older versions of them. You must also keep the documents in a safe place, either in a home safe, in the top drawer of a secure file cabinet in your home, or in your safe-deposit box.\\n\\nNotify your executor of the whereabouts of your estate-planning documents, and provide copies of the relevant documents to your executor, agents for powers of attorney, and the guardian for your children.\\n\\nStep 6: Don't Neglect the Softer Side of Estate Planning\\n\\nThis may include considersations like: If you end up needing long-term care, would you rather receive that care at home, provided you could afford it? If in the unlikely scenario your guardians have to care for your minor children, what are the key values you'd like them to impart to your kids?\\n\\nStep 7: Plan to Keep Your Plan Current\\n\\nPlan to notify your estate-planning attorney, and possibly revise your documents, if you experience any of the following:\\n\\nChange in marital or family status (for example, marriage, divorce, birth, or adoption of child)\\n\\nDeath or ill health of executor, power of attorneys, or guardian\\n\\n___\\n\\nChristine Benz of Morningstar\\n\\nThis article was provided to The Associated Press by Morningstar.\", 'source': {'uri': 'thenationalherald.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The National Herald'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'achilleas_kouremenos@thenationalherald.com', 'name': 'Achilleas Kouremenos', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AP24323740642696-scaled.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-10099645', 'sentiment': 0.2627450980392156, 'wgt': 253, 'relevance': 26}, {'uri': '2024-11-555341487', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-11-24', 'time': '09:12:51', 'dateTime': '2024-11-24T09:12:51Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-11-24T09:05:24Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9882352948188782, 'url': 'https://newsdiaryonline.com/indian-investor-to-boost-nigeria-health-care-sector-with-100-million-investment/', 'title': 'Indian Investor To Boost Nigeria Health Care Sector With $100 Million Investment', 'body': 'Nigeria-India investment relations got a boost, on Sunday, when Indian Origin Healthcare Group Padiyath Healthcare revealed that it has earmarked investment worth $100 million in the Nigeria\\'s healthcare sector.\\n\\nThis disclosure was made by Padiyath Healthcare chairman Dr. Hazeeb Rahman Padiyath, during an address by visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in Abuja.\\n\\nAccording to Padiyath, the investments when completed will enable Nigerians access world class hospital at affordable cost.\\n\\nHe disclosed that already the company is set to commission a world-class hospital, in Abuja as part of the long term investment drive of the India company, in the country.\\n\\nAccording to him the first one is the \"Padiyath Mayfields Hospitals\", a 300-bed tertiary care hospital which is being constructed in Suncity estates, Galadimawa, Abuja,\" adding that \"When commissioned it will be Nigeria\\'s largest private sector hospital\".\\n\\nHe told the visiting India PM that the \"hospital brings in advanced diagnostic equipments like 3T MRI. 256 Slice CT Scan Machine which will be the first of its kind in western Africa along with Cardiac cathlab, 24 Super speciality centers of excellence, 25 bedded Intensive care unit, Operation theatre in emergency department itself in addition to the Operation Theater complex in the 3rd floor which can be lifesaving in times of emergency\".\\n\\nHe said the project will be ready for unveiling by February 2025.\\n\\nThe India investor disclosed that the second Hospital Padiyath Cancare Hospitals which will also be domiciled in Abuja will be a 200-bed hospital world class cancer institute.\\n\\n\"This center will be a full-fledged cancer hospital with equipments like Pet Scan, Linear accelerator & Gamma knife,\" Dr. Padiyath said.\\n\\nThe Group Padiyath healthcare is true Indian multinational healthcare provider with operations in India, middle east & Africa, the company boss said.\\n\\nThe Africa expansions are spearheaded by Dr. Padiyath.

significant investment from Thoma Bravo and ADIA\", 'body': 'Dubai, United Arab Emirates - Thoma Bravo, a leading software investment firm, today announced it has signed an agreement to sell a significant minority stake in Qlik®, a global leader in data integration, data quality, analytics, and AI, to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). As part of the terms of the transaction, Thoma Bravo would remain the majority shareholder and would also make a new equity investment in the company. A consortium of other investors is expected to invest alongside ADIA and Thoma Bravo. This transaction reinforces Qlik\\'s leadership in delivering real-world AI solutions through a flexible, agnostic platform.\\n\\nSince taking the company private, Thoma Bravo has partnered with the Qlik leadership team to accelerate growth through 14 strategic acquisitions and substantial R&D investments. Qlik serves customers across a wide range of industries, including healthcare, financial services, retail, and the public sector. Its solutions empower organizations to bring data together, make sense of it, trust it, analyze it, and take action.\\n\\nThe recently launched Qlik Talend® Cloud enables businesses to build a trusted foundation for AI, while Qlik Answers™ brings value to proprietary unstructured data sources by generating relevant answers to questions with full explainability. Qlik\\'s platform supports comprehensive data needs across cloud, multi-cloud, and on-premises environments.\\n\\nMike Capone, CEO of Qlik, said, \"We look forward to accelerating Qlik\\'s impact in the era of AI and welcome ADIA into our next phase of growth. Our team has seized the AI opportunity, grounded in a commitment to strong partnerships, customer success, and solutions that drive real competitive advantage. These principles have fueled our growth and enabled us to deliver meaningful, tangible value from data and analytics.\"\\n\\n\"It has been a pleasure to work alongside Mike and the Qlik team to establish it as a leader in data integration, data quality, analytics, and AI.

It's helpful to think of estate planning as a process rather than something that's one-and-done and begins and ends in an attorney's office.\\n\\nHere are the key steps to take.\\n\\nStep 1: Find a Qualified Attorney\\n\\nStart by asking other financial professionals who you work with -- whether a financial advisor or an accountant -- for recommendations. If you have a specific situation that is likely to affect your estate plan -- for example, if you're a small-business owner or if you have a child with special needs -- be sure to ask for referrals to attorneys who are well-versed in those areas.\\n\\nBefore you select an attorney, it's perfectly reasonable to conduct a basic informational interview.\\n\\nAs you speak with a prospective estate-planning attorney, also weigh the intangibles. Do you like this person, and would you be comfortable supplying him or her with personal information about your finances and family situation?\\n\\nStep 2: Take Stock of Your Assets\\n\\nSpend time enumerating your assets and their value: your investment accounts as well as life insurance, personal assets such as your home, and your share of any businesses that you own. You should also gather current information about any debts outstanding. Your estate-planning attorney is likely to provide you with a worksheet to document your assets and liabilities, but it's helpful to collect this information in advance.\\n\\nStep 3: Identify Key Individuals\\n\\nYou'll need individuals to fill the following key roles. Note that the same individual can fulfill more than one role.\\n\\nExecutor: A person who gathers all of your assets and makes sure that they are distributed as spelled out in your will. Many people call upon family members to serve as executors, but it's also possible -- and in some cases desirable -- to hire a professional.\\n\\nDurable (or Financial) Power of Attorney: A durable power of attorney is a document that grants an individual the legal authority to make financial decisions on your behalf if you should become disabled and unable to manage your own financial affairs.\\n\\nPower of Attorney for Healthcare: A power of attorney for healthcare is a document that specifies whom you entrust with making healthcare decisions on your behalf if you are disabled and unable to make them on your own.\\n\\nGuardian: A person who would look after your children if you and your spouse were to die when your children are minors.\\n\\nStep 4: Know the Key Documents You Need\\n\\nAt a minimum, you should ask your attorney to draft the following:\\n\\nLast Will and Testament: A legal document that tells everyone -- including your heirs -- how you would like your assets distributed after you're gone.\\n\\nLiving Will: A document that tells your loved ones and your healthcare providers how you would like to be cared for if you should become terminally ill.\\n\\nStep 5: Manage Your Documents\\n\\nOnce your estate-planning documents are drafted, destroy any older versions of them. You must also keep the documents in a safe place, either in a home safe, in the top drawer of a secure file cabinet in your home, or in your safe-deposit box.\\n\\nNotify your executor of the whereabouts of your estate-planning documents, and provide copies of the relevant documents to your executor, agents for powers of attorney, and the guardian for your children.\\n\\nStep 6: Don't Neglect the Softer Side of Estate Planning\\n\\nThis may include considersations like: If you end up needing long-term care, would you rather receive that care at home, provided you could afford it? If in the unlikely scenario your guardians have to care for your minor children, what are the key values you'd like them to impart to your kids?\\n\\nStep 7: Plan to Keep Your Plan Current\\n\\nPlan to notify your estate-planning attorney, and possibly revise your documents, if you experience any of the following:\\n\\nChange in marital or family status (for example, marriage, divorce, birth, or adoption of child)\\n\\nMajor change in assets -- either sale or purchase\\n\\nMajor change in financial status\\n\\nDeath or ill health of one of your beneficiaries\\n\\nDeath or ill health of executor, power of attorneys, or guardian\\n\\nThis article was provided to The Associated Press by Morningstar.

Do you like this person, and would you be comfortable supplying him or her with personal information about your finances and family situation?\\n\\nStep 2: Take Stock of Your Assets\\n\\nSpend time enumerating your assets and their value: your investment accounts as well as life insurance, personal assets such as your home, and your share of any businesses that you own. You should also gather current information about any debts outstanding. Your estate-planning attorney is likely to provide you with a worksheet to document your assets and liabilities, but it's helpful to collect this information in advance.\\n\\nStep 3: Identify Key Individuals\\n\\nYou'll need individuals to fill the following key roles. Note that the same individual can fulfill more than one role.\\n\\nExecutor: A person who gathers all of your assets and makes sure that they are distributed as spelled out in your will. Many people call upon family members to serve as executors, but it's also possible -- and in some cases desirable -- to hire a professional.\\n\\nDurable (or Financial) Power of Attorney: A durable power of attorney is a document that grants an individual the legal authority to make financial decisions on your behalf if you should become disabled and unable to manage your own financial affairs.\\n\\nPower of Attorney for Healthcare: A power of attorney for healthcare is a document that specifies whom you entrust with making healthcare decisions on your behalf if you are disabled and unable to make them on your own.\\n\\nGuardian: A person who would look after your children if you and your spouse were to die when your children are minors.\\n\\nStep 4: Know the Key Documents You Need\\n\\nAt a minimum, you should ask your attorney to draft the following:\\n\\nLast Will and Testament: A legal document that tells everyone -- including your heirs -- how you would like your assets distributed after you're gone.\\n\\nLiving Will: A document that tells your loved ones and your healthcare providers how you would like to be cared for if you should become terminally ill.\\n\\nStep 5: Manage Your Documents\\n\\nOnce your estate-planning documents are drafted, destroy any older versions of them. You must also keep the documents in a safe place, either in a home safe, in the top drawer of a secure file cabinet in your home, or in your safe-deposit box.\\n\\nNotify your executor of the whereabouts of your estate-planning documents, and provide copies of the relevant documents to your executor, agents for powers of attorney, and the guardian for your children.\\n\\nStep 6: Don't Neglect the Softer Side of Estate Planning\\n\\nThis may include considersations like: If you end up needing long-term care, would you rather receive that care at home, provided you could afford it? If in the unlikely scenario your guardians have to care for your minor children, what are the key values you'd like them to impart to your kids?\\n\\nStep 7: Plan to Keep Your Plan Current\\n\\nPlan to notify your estate-planning attorney, and possibly revise your documents, if you experience any of the following:\\n\\nChange in marital or family status (for example, marriage, divorce, birth, or adoption of child)\\n\\nDeath or ill health of executor, power of attorneys, or guardian\\n\\n___\\n\\nChristine Benz of Morningstar\\n\\nThis article was provided to The Associated Press by Morningstar.\", 'source': {'uri': 'thenationalherald.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The National Herald'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'achilleas_kouremenos@thenationalherald.com', 'name': 'Achilleas Kouremenos', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AP24323740642696-scaled.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-10099645', 'sentiment': 0.2627450980392156, 'wgt': 253, 'relevance': 26}, {'uri': '2024-11-555341487', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-11-24', 'time': '09:12:51', 'dateTime': '2024-11-24T09:12:51Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-11-24T09:05:24Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9882352948188782, 'url': 'https://newsdiaryonline.com/indian-investor-to-boost-nigeria-health-care-sector-with-100-million-investment/', 'title': 'Indian Investor To Boost Nigeria Health Care Sector With $100 Million Investment', 'body': 'Nigeria-India investment relations got a boost, on Sunday, when Indian Origin Healthcare Group Padiyath Healthcare revealed that it has earmarked investment worth $100 million in the Nigeria\\'s healthcare sector.\\n\\nThis disclosure was made by Padiyath Healthcare chairman Dr. Hazeeb Rahman Padiyath, during an address by visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in Abuja.\\n\\nAccording to Padiyath, the investments when completed will enable Nigerians access world class hospital at affordable cost.\\n\\nHe disclosed that already the company is set to commission a world-class hospital, in Abuja as part of the long term investment drive of the India company, in the country.\\n\\nAccording to him the first one is the \"Padiyath Mayfields Hospitals\", a 300-bed tertiary care hospital which is being constructed in Suncity estates, Galadimawa, Abuja,\" adding that \"When commissioned it will be Nigeria\\'s largest private sector hospital\".\\n\\nHe told the visiting India PM that the \"hospital brings in advanced diagnostic equipments like 3T MRI. 256 Slice CT Scan Machine which will be the first of its kind in western Africa along with Cardiac cathlab, 24 Super speciality centers of excellence, 25 bedded Intensive care unit, Operation theatre in emergency department itself in addition to the Operation Theater complex in the 3rd floor which can be lifesaving in times of emergency\".\\n\\nHe said the project will be ready for unveiling by February 2025.\\n\\nThe India investor disclosed that the second Hospital Padiyath Cancare Hospitals which will also be domiciled in Abuja will be a 200-bed hospital world class cancer institute.\\n\\n\"This center will be a full-fledged cancer hospital with equipments like Pet Scan, Linear accelerator & Gamma knife,\" Dr. Padiyath said.\\n\\nThe Group Padiyath healthcare is true Indian multinational healthcare provider with operations in India, middle east & Africa, the company boss said.\\n\\nThe Africa expansions are spearheaded by Dr. Padiyath.

It's helpful to think of estate planning as a process rather than something that's one-and-done and begins and ends in an attorney's office.\\n\\nHere are the key steps to take.\\n\\nStep 1: Find a Qualified Attorney\\n\\nStart by asking other financial professionals who you work with -- whether a financial advisor or an accountant -- for recommendations. If you have a specific situation that is likely to affect your estate plan -- for example, if you're a small-business owner or if you have a child with special needs -- be sure to ask for referrals to attorneys who are well-versed in those areas.\\n\\nBefore you select an attorney, it's perfectly reasonable to conduct a basic informational interview.\\n\\nAs you speak with a prospective estate-planning attorney, also weigh the intangibles. Do you like this person, and would you be comfortable supplying him or her with personal information about your finances and family situation?\\n\\nStep 2: Take Stock of Your Assets\\n\\nSpend time enumerating your assets and their value: your investment accounts as well as life insurance, personal assets such as your home, and your share of any businesses that you own. You should also gather current information about any debts outstanding. Your estate-planning attorney is likely to provide you with a worksheet to document your assets and liabilities, but it's helpful to collect this information in advance.\\n\\nStep 3: Identify Key Individuals\\n\\nYou'll need individuals to fill the following key roles. Note that the same individual can fulfill more than one role.\\n\\nExecutor: A person who gathers all of your assets and makes sure that they are distributed as spelled out in your will. Many people call upon family members to serve as executors, but it's also possible -- and in some cases desirable -- to hire a professional.\\n\\nDurable (or Financial) Power of Attorney: A durable power of attorney is a document that grants an individual the legal authority to make financial decisions on your behalf if you should become disabled and unable to manage your own financial affairs.\\n\\nPower of Attorney for Healthcare: A power of attorney for healthcare is a document that specifies whom you entrust with making healthcare decisions on your behalf if you are disabled and unable to make them on your own.\\n\\nGuardian: A person who would look after your children if you and your spouse were to die when your children are minors.\\n\\nStep 4: Know the Key Documents You Need\\n\\nAt a minimum, you should ask your attorney to draft the following:\\n\\nLast Will and Testament: A legal document that tells everyone -- including your heirs -- how you would like your assets distributed after you're gone.\\n\\nLiving Will: A document that tells your loved ones and your healthcare providers how you would like to be cared for if you should become terminally ill.\\n\\nStep 5: Manage Your Documents\\n\\nOnce your estate-planning documents are drafted, destroy any older versions of them. You must also keep the documents in a safe place, either in a home safe, in the top drawer of a secure file cabinet in your home, or in your safe-deposit box.\\n\\nNotify your executor of the whereabouts of your estate-planning documents, and provide copies of the relevant documents to your executor, agents for powers of attorney, and the guardian for your children.\\n\\nStep 6: Don't Neglect the Softer Side of Estate Planning\\n\\nThis may include considersations like: If you end up needing long-term care, would you rather receive that care at home, provided you could afford it? If in the unlikely scenario your guardians have to care for your minor children, what are the key values you'd like them to impart to your kids?\\n\\nStep 7: Plan to Keep Your Plan Current\\n\\nPlan to notify your estate-planning attorney, and possibly revise your documents, if you experience any of the following:\\n\\nChange in marital or family status (for example, marriage, divorce, birth, or adoption of child)\\n\\nMajor change in assets -- either sale or purchase\\n\\nMajor change in financial status\\n\\nDeath or ill health of one of your beneficiaries\\n\\nDeath or ill health of executor, power of attorneys, or guardian\\n\\nThis article was provided to The Associated Press by Morningstar.

(NYSE: MD), a leading provider of physician services, today reported earnings of $0.23 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024. On a non-GAAP basis, Pediatrix reported Adjusted EPS of $0.44.\\n\\nFor the 2024 third quarter, Pediatrix reported the following results:\\n\\nNet revenue of $511 million;Net income of $19 million; andAdjusted EBITDA of $60 million.\\n\\n\"Our third quarter operating results modestly exceeded our expectations, driven primarily by strength in same-unit revenue,\" said James D. Swift, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Pediatrix Medical Group. \"During the quarter, we successfully completed our previously announced transition to a hybrid revenue cycle management structure, and we remain on track to complete our portfolio management plans by the end of 2024. We believe that a more focused portfolio, with enhanced support for our affiliated practices, will enable stronger financial performance and benefit all of our stakeholders.\"\\n\\nOperating Results- Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\\n\\nPediatrix\\'s net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $511.2 million, compared to $506.6 million for the prior-year period. This increase reflected growth in same-unit revenue of 5.2 percent, partially offset by the impact of non-same unit activity, primarily practice dispositions.\\n\\nSame-unit revenue from net reimbursement-related factors increased by 3.4 percent for the 2024 third quarter as compared to the prior-year period. This increase primarily reflects improved payor mix and modest improvements in hospital contract administrative fees. The percentage of services reimbursed by commercial and other non-government payors increased by approximately 250 basis points compared to the prior year period.\\n\\nSame-unit revenue attributable to patient volume increased by 1.8 percent for the 2024 third quarter as compared to the prior-year period. Shown below are year-over-year percentage changes in certain same-unit volume statistics for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

This comparison primarily reflects the impact of practice disposition activity and a decrease in same-unit medical malpractice expense, partially offset by increases in same-unit clinical compensation costs, including incentive compensation based on practice results.\\n\\nFor the 2024 third quarter, general and administrative expenses were $58.1 million, as compared to $57.4 million for the prior-year period. This comparison primarily reflects higher incentive compensation based on financial results and increased internal staffing as part of the Company\\'s development of its hybrid revenue cycle management structure, largely offset by net staffing reductions.\\n\\nFor 2024 third quarter, transformational and restructuring related expenses totaled $18.6 million. These expenses related primarily to revenue cycle management transition activities and practice dispositions.\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA, which is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, transformational and restructuring related expenses, and loss on disposal of businesses, was $60.2 million for the 2024 third quarter, compared to $50.4 million for the prior-year period.\\n\\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $6.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $9.2 million for the prior-year period. This comparison was primarily related to a decrease in depreciation expense related to non-same unit activity, primarily practice dispositions.\\n\\nInterest expense was $10.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $10.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\\n\\nPediatrix generated net income of $19.4 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the 2024 third quarter, based on a weighted average 84.5 million shares outstanding. This compares with net income of $21.4 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the 2023 third quarter, based on a weighted average 83.0 million shares outstanding.\\n\\nFor the third quarter of 2024, Pediatrix reported Adjusted EPS of $0.44, compared to $0.32 for the third quarter of 2023. For these periods, Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted income per common and common equivalent share excluding non-cash amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, transformational and restructuring related expenses, loss on disposal of businesses, tax effects of goodwill impairment and discrete tax events.\\n\\nOperating Results - Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\\n\\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Pediatrix generated revenue of $1.51 billion, compared to $1.50 billion for the prior-year period. Pediatrix generated a net loss of $129.5 million, or $1.56 per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, based on a weighted average 83.2 million shares outstanding, which compares to income of $63.9 million, or $0.77 per share, based on a weighted average 82.5 million shares outstanding for the first nine months of 2023.

At September 30, 2024, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its $450 million revolving line of credit.\\n\\nPortfolio Management Update\\n\\nAs previously disclosed, during the second quarter of 2024, Pediatrix formalized its practice portfolio management plans, resulting in a decision to exit almost all of its affiliated office-based practices, other than maternal-fetal medicine, and during and subsequent to the end of the 2024 second quarter, the Company completed the exit of its primary and urgent care service line through two separate transactions. In aggregate, the office-based practices that the Company intends to exit and the primary and urgent care clinics that have been divested contributed net revenue of approximately $200 million in 2023. As previously disclosed, Pediatrix expects that the annualized favorable impact to Adjusted EBITDA resulting from its portfolio management plans to be approximately $30 million, based on 2023 financial information.\\n\\nThe Company continues to expect to complete these exits prior to the end of 2024.\\n\\n2024 Outlook\\n\\nPediatrix anticipates that its 2024 Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, will be in a range of $205 million to $215 million. This outlook reflects Adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of 2024 of $155.3 million.\\n\\nNon-GAAP Measures\\n\\nA reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is provided in the financial tables of this press release.\\n\\nEarnings Conference Call\\n\\nPediatrix will host an investor conference call to discuss the quarterly results at 9 a.m., ET today.

It's helpful to think of estate planning as a process rather than something that's one-and-done and begins and ends in an attorney's office.\\n\\nStart by asking other financial professionals who you work with -- whether a financial advisor or an accountant -- for recommendations. If you have a specific situation that is likely to affect your estate plan -- for example, if you're a small-business owner or if you have a child with special needs -- be sure to ask for referrals to attorneys who are well-versed in those areas.\\n\\nBefore you select an attorney, it's perfectly reasonable to conduct a basic informational interview.\\n\\nAs you speak with a prospective estate-planning attorney, also weigh the intangibles. Do you like this person, and would you be comfortable supplying him or her with personal information about your finances and family situation?\\n\\nStep 2: Take Stock of Your Assets\\n\\nSpend time enumerating your assets and their value: your investment accounts as well as life insurance, personal assets such as your home, and your share of any businesses that you own. You should also gather current information about any debts outstanding. Your estate-planning attorney is likely to provide you with a worksheet to document your assets and liabilities, but it's helpful to collect this information in advance.\\n\\nStep 3: Identify Key Individuals\\n\\nYou'll need individuals to fill the following key roles. Note that the same individual can fulfill more than one role.\\n\\nExecutor: A person who gathers all of your assets and makes sure that they are distributed as spelled out in your will. Many people call upon family members to serve as executors, but it's also possible -- and in some cases desirable -- to hire a professional.\\n\\nDurable (or Financial) Power of Attorney: A durable power of attorney is a document that grants an individual the legal authority to make financial decisions on your behalf if you should become disabled and unable to manage your own financial affairs.\\n\\nPower of Attorney for Healthcare: A power of attorney for healthcare is a document that specifies whom you entrust with making healthcare decisions on your behalf if you are disabled and unable to make them on your own.\\n\\nGuardian: A person who would look after your children if you and your spouse were to die when your children are minors.\\n\\nStep 4: Know the Key Documents You Need\\n\\nAt a minimum, you should ask your attorney to draft the following:\\n\\nLast Will and Testament: A legal document that tells everyone -- including your heirs -- how you would like your assets distributed after you're gone.\\n\\nLiving Will: A document that tells your loved ones and your healthcare providers how you would like to be cared for if you should become terminally ill.\\n\\nStep 5: Manage Your Documents\\n\\nOnce your estate-planning documents are drafted, destroy any older versions of them. You must also keep the documents in a safe place, either in a home safe, in the top drawer of a secure file cabinet in your home, or in your safe-deposit box.\\n\\nNotify your executor of the whereabouts of your estate-planning documents, and provide copies of the relevant documents to your executor, agents for powers of attorney, and the guardian for your children.\\n\\nStep 6: Don't Neglect the Softer Side of Estate Planning\\n\\nThis may include considersations like: If you end up needing long-term care, would you rather receive that care at home, provided you could afford it? If in the unlikely scenario your guardians have to care for your minor children, what are the key values you'd like them to impart to your kids?\\n\\nStep 7: Plan to Keep Your Plan Current\\n\\nPlan to notify your estate-planning attorney, and possibly revise your documents, if you experience any of the following:\\n\\nChange in marital or family status (for example, marriage, divorce, birth, or adoption of child)\\n\\nDeath or ill health of executor, power of attorneys, or guardian\\n\\n___\\n\\nChristine Benz of Morningstar\\n\\nThis article was provided to The Associated Press by Morningstar.\", 'source': {'uri': 'thenationalherald.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The National Herald'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'achilleas_kouremenos@thenationalherald.com', 'name': 'Achilleas Kouremenos', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AP24323740642696-scaled.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-10099645', 'sentiment': 0.2627450980392156, 'wgt': 253, 'relevance': 26}, {'uri': '2024-11-555341487', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-11-24', 'time': '09:12:51', 'dateTime': '2024-11-24T09:12:51Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-11-24T09:05:24Z', 'dataType': 'news', 'sim': 0.9882352948188782, 'url': 'https://newsdiaryonline.com/indian-investor-to-boost-nigeria-health-care-sector-with-100-million-investment/', 'title': 'Indian Investor To Boost Nigeria Health Care Sector With $100 Million Investment', 'body': 'Nigeria-India investment relations got a boost, on Sunday, when Indian Origin Healthcare Group Padiyath Healthcare revealed that it has earmarked investment worth $100 million in the Nigeria\\'s healthcare sector.\\n\\nThis disclosure was made by Padiyath Healthcare chairman Dr. Hazeeb Rahman Padiyath, during an address by visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in Abuja.\\n\\nAccording to Padiyath, the investments when completed will enable Nigerians access world class hospital at affordable cost.\\n\\nHe disclosed that already the company is set to commission a world-class hospital, in Abuja as part of the long term investment drive of the India company, in the country.\\n\\nAccording to him the first one is the \"Padiyath Mayfields Hospitals\", a 300-bed tertiary care hospital which is being constructed in Suncity estates, Galadimawa, Abuja,\" adding that \"When commissioned it will be Nigeria\\'s largest private sector hospital\".\\n\\nHe told the visiting India PM that the \"hospital brings in advanced diagnostic equipments like 3T MRI. 256 Slice CT Scan Machine which will be the first of its kind in western Africa along with Cardiac cathlab, 24 Super speciality centers of excellence, 25 bedded Intensive care unit, Operation theatre in emergency department itself in addition to the Operation Theater complex in the 3rd floor which can be lifesaving in times of emergency\".\\n\\nHe said the project will be ready for unveiling by February 2025.\\n\\nThe India investor disclosed that the second Hospital Padiyath Cancare Hospitals which will also be domiciled in Abuja will be a 200-bed hospital world class cancer institute.\\n\\n\"This center will be a full-fledged cancer hospital with equipments like Pet Scan, Linear accelerator & Gamma knife,\" Dr. Padiyath said.\\n\\nThe Group Padiyath healthcare is true Indian multinational healthcare provider with operations in India, middle east & Africa, the company boss said.\\n\\nThe Africa expansions are spearheaded by Dr. Padiyath.

It's helpful to think of estate planning as a process rather than something that's one-and-done and begins and ends in an attorney's office.\\n\\nHere are the key steps to take.\\n\\nStep 1: Find a Qualified Attorney\\n\\nStart by asking other financial professionals who you work with -- whether a financial advisor or an accountant -- for recommendations. If you have a specific situation that is likely to affect your estate plan -- for example, if you're a small-business owner or if you have a child with special needs -- be sure to ask for referrals to attorneys who are well-versed in those areas.\\n\\nBefore you select an attorney, it's perfectly reasonable to conduct a basic informational interview.\\n\\nAs you speak with a prospective estate-planning attorney, also weigh the intangibles. Do you like this person, and would you be comfortable supplying him or her with personal information about your finances and family situation?\\n\\nStep 2: Take Stock of Your Assets\\n\\nSpend time enumerating your assets and their value: your investment accounts as well as life insurance, personal assets such as your home, and your share of any businesses that you own. You should also gather current information about any debts outstanding. Your estate-planning attorney is likely to provide you with a worksheet to document your assets and liabilities, but it's helpful to collect this information in advance.\\n\\nStep 3: Identify Key Individuals\\n\\nYou'll need individuals to fill the following key roles. Note that the same individual can fulfill more than one role.\\n\\nExecutor: A person who gathers all of your assets and makes sure that they are distributed as spelled out in your will. Many people call upon family members to serve as executors, but it's also possible -- and in some cases desirable -- to hire a professional.\\n\\nDurable (or Financial) Power of Attorney: A durable power of attorney is a document that grants an individual the legal authority to make financial decisions on your behalf if you should become disabled and unable to manage your own financial affairs.\\n\\nPower of Attorney for Healthcare: A power of attorney for healthcare is a document that specifies whom you entrust with making healthcare decisions on your behalf if you are disabled and unable to make them on your own.\\n\\nGuardian: A person who would look after your children if you and your spouse were to die when your children are minors.\\n\\nStep 4: Know the Key Documents You Need\\n\\nAt a minimum, you should ask your attorney to draft the following:\\n\\nLast Will and Testament: A legal document that tells everyone -- including your heirs -- how you would like your assets distributed after you're gone.\\n\\nLiving Will: A document that tells your loved ones and your healthcare providers how you would like to be cared for if you should become terminally ill.\\n\\nStep 5: Manage Your Documents\\n\\nOnce your estate-planning documents are drafted, destroy any older versions of them. You must also keep the documents in a safe place, either in a home safe, in the top drawer of a secure file cabinet in your home, or in your safe-deposit box.\\n\\nNotify your executor of the whereabouts of your estate-planning documents, and provide copies of the relevant documents to your executor, agents for powers of attorney, and the guardian for your children.\\n\\nStep 6: Don't Neglect the Softer Side of Estate Planning\\n\\nThis may include considersations like: If you end up needing long-term care, would you rather receive that care at home, provided you could afford it? If in the unlikely scenario your guardians have to care for your minor children, what are the key values you'd like them to impart to your kids?\\n\\nStep 7: Plan to Keep Your Plan Current\\n\\nPlan to notify your estate-planning attorney, and possibly revise your documents, if you experience any of the following:\\n\\nChange in marital or family status (for example, marriage, divorce, birth, or adoption of child)\\n\\nMajor change in assets -- either sale or purchase\\n\\nMajor change in financial status\\n\\nDeath or ill health of one of your beneficiaries\\n\\nDeath or ill health of executor, power of attorneys, or guardian\\n\\nThis article was provided to The Associated Press by Morningstar.

      "### Investment Decision: Should You Buy Stocks from Pediatrix Medical Group?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation: Hold (Confidence Level: Medium)**\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Summary of Findings:\n",
      "Pediatrix Medical Group has recently reported strong financial results, including a third-quarter profit of $19.4 million and revenues of $511.2 million, which exceeded Wall Street expectations. However, the lack of recent trading data and insider activity raises concerns about market engagement and potential volatility. Given your moderate risk tolerance and medium-term investment horizon, a cautious approach is advisable.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Key Financial Metrics:\n",
      "- **Q3 Earnings**: Profit of $19.4 million; adjusted earnings of 44 cents per share.\n",
      "- **Revenue**: $511.2 million, driven by a 5% increase in same-unit revenue.\n",
      "- **Adjusted EBITDA Outlook**: Projected between $205 million and $215 million for 2024.\n",
      "- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: 0.83, indicating a relatively high level of debt.\n",
      "- **Net Margin**: -12.65%, suggesting potential financial risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Market Context:\n",
      "- **Sector Growth**: The healthcare sector, particularly pediatric services, is experiencing growth due to increasing demand for specialized care.\n",
      "- **Restructuring Efforts**: The company is transitioning to a hybrid revenue cycle management structure, which is expected to enhance financial performance.\n",
      "- **Analyst Ratings**: The stock is currently rated as \"Hold\" by several analysts, with price targets ranging from $15.00 to $18.00, averaging around $16.10.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Technical Analysis:\n",
      "- **Data Limitations**: There is currently no recent trading data available, making it difficult to assess price trends, volume patterns, or technical indicators.\n",
      "- **Market Sentiment**: The overall sentiment remains neutral, with no strong bullish or bearish indicators in recent news.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Actionable Insights:\n",
      "1. **Monitor Developments**: Keep an eye on upcoming earnings reports and further updates regarding the restructuring plan, as these could serve as catalysts for stock movement.\n",
      "2. **Consider Alternative Investments**: Given the lack of trading activity and the neutral sentiment, you might want to explore other investment opportunities with clearer growth trajectories and available data.\n",
      "3. **Portfolio Management**: If you currently hold Pediatrix Medical Group shares, consider maintaining your position while monitoring for signs of sustained growth or further developments in the company's restructuring efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Conclusion:\n",
      "While Pediatrix Medical Group has shown promising financial results, the absence of recent trading data and the overall neutral market sentiment suggest a cautious approach. Holding your position is recommended until clearer signals of sustained growth emerge.\n",
